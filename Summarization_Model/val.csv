"new delhi, jul    (pti) no proposal is under consideration to scrap the sahayak system in the army, the government today said, notwithstanding rising cases of jawans coming out openly against the colonial-era provision. the clarification by minister of state for defence subhash bhamre came in the lok sabha in response to a question. ""no proposal for scrapping the sahayak system, presently in place in the army, is under consideration in the ministry at present,"" he said, in a brief written reply. under the sahayak or buddy system, a solider is attached to officers and their duties include protecting the officers, maintaining their weapons and equipment and helping them in carrying out their responsibilities. last month, a senior army official had said that the force is actively considering recruiting civilian staff in peace stations to do away with the sakayak system. earlier this year, a number of videos had surfaced where some army jawans were seen voicing their anger over the sahayak system with some even alleging that they are treated as servants by the officers whom they are attached to. to a separate question, bhamre said complaints by serving soldiers are dealt with by authorities concerned according to existing rules and policies. he said a study conducted by the defence institute of psychological research concluded that the major causes of suicides in the army are domestic problems, marital discord, stress and financial problems. ","the centre informed the lok sabha there is no proposal in consideration to scrap sahayak or buddy system in the army. this comes after several jawans voiced their outrage against the system saying they are treated like servants by senior officers. notably, under sahayak system, a jawan is attached to officers and their duties include protecting and helping the officers."

"director: ashtar sayed cast: raveena tandon, madhur mittal, divya jagdale, anurag arora, rushad ranarating:  ( . / ) not without my daughter, taken, the brave one are just some of the hollywood thrillers that come to mind when sitting through maatr, a revenge drama, in which a traumatised mother takes the law into her own hands and tracks down the killers. but writer michael pellico throws in indian references to in the mahabharata and the brutal gangrape which is reminiscent of the nirbhaya case. for all its grittiness, maatr is barely able to skim the surface of a woman's paranoia unlike pink, another drama about sexual assault which is set in the capital.raveena tandon plays vidya, a teacher, who witnesses her bright daughter's brutal rape and subsequent demise. she is a bruised, battered victim herself but the makers pretty much sideline vidya's trauma to focus on her grief. here too one of the perpetrators is a man with influence, in this case it's the bratty son (madhur mittal of slumdog millionaire) of the chief minister. this is one of the earlier signs that in maatr playing out extremities is more important than allowing moments of reflection and empathy. when justice is out of her reach (""it's not like filter coffee that you get it instantly""), vidya with a little help of facebook, google maps, email, drugs and a gun plots the death of the seven accused. while some are well-executed, most are a bit sudden and haphazard. the latter makes the film occasionally germane and at times improbable. tandon does well as the more amateurish liam neeson but one wishes for more context to her character instead of just a well-coiffed, vengeful, death magnet of a mother. little time is devoted to her doomed marriage with an inconsiderate husband who blames her poor navigation skills for the tragedy. as the sole witness of the murder and survivor she is also surprisingly given too much free reign to execute her plan. another minor sexual assault victim is included to heighten the anger, but in maatr this seems more a lazy plot convenience. as the clock approaches the hour mark, sayed raises the violence quotient adding kicks and punches to the action but the blows don't quite have the emotional impact. maatr despite the gravity of the theme is a subpar drama. the film would have been more effective if the mawkish, flashback-heavy songs were skipped. maatr is a missed opportunity to make a powerful statement against india's poor track record in dispensing justice and tackling violence against women. revenge is a dish best served cold; in maatr it's crass and oddly flat too. ","raveena tandon's 'maatr' which released on friday, ""is successful...in how it approaches rape as it doesn't trivialise the subject,"" wrote hindustan times. ""maatr a drama with too many blows but little depth,"" said india today. toi wrote, ""raveena's sincere as the victim who sullies her hands to get justice."" it was rated  /  (toi),  /  (ht)  . /  (india today)."

"los angeles, may    (pti) chemicals found in chinese folk medicines may be used to make next generation of molecular condoms that may serve as a safe alternative to todays hormone-based contraceptives, scientists say. the chemicals, extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, are effective at low doses and have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, other than preventing a key step in fertilisation - the meeting of egg and sperm. they work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. according to researchers from the university of california (uc) berkeley in the us, the chemicals may serve as an emergency contraceptive taken either before or after intercourse, or as a permanent contraceptive via a skin patch or vaginal ring. human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick. also, because the chemicals prevent fertilisation, they may be a more acceptable alternative in the eyes of those who object to emergency contraceptives that prevent the implantation of a potentially viable fertilised egg. these two plant compounds block fertilisation at very low concentrations - about    times lower than levels of levonorgestrel in emergency contraceptives, said polina lishko, an assistant professor at uc berkeley. ""they could be a new generation of emergency contraceptive we nicknamed molecular condoms,"" said lishko, who led the team that discovered the anti-fertility properties of the two chemicals. ""if one can use a plant-derived, non-toxic, non-hormonal compound in lesser concentration to prevent fertilisation in the first place, it could potentially be a better option,"" she said. purusing books on natural contraceptives used by indigenous peoples around the world, researchers came across several non-steroid chemicals isolated from anti-fertility plants. one of these was pristimerin, from the plant tripterygium wilfordii, also known as ""thunder god vine."" leaves from the plant have been used as an antifertility drug in chinese traditional medicine, though some compounds in the leaves are poisonous. it has also been used as a folk remedy for rheumatoid arthritis. the other chemical was lupeol, which is found in plants such as mango and dandelion root. while it has been tested as an anticancer agent, it was not suspected of having contraceptive properties.

""akshay was given the best actor on the basis of his performance in two films -- airlift and rustom. it was the jury's decision. one performance was dramatic and one was realistic. but according to the rule book, only one film can be mentioned and rustom was mentioned in the list. but the award recognises his performance in both the movies,""said priyadarshan.this year saw the dominance of regional cinema at the national film awards with marathi film kasaav winning best feature film, surabhi cm getting best actress and rajesh mapuskar being named best director for marathi movie ventilator. bollywood films which managed to score are pink (best film on social issues), dhanak (best children's film) and neerja (best hindi film). priyadarshan says regional films don't chase after box office numbers and that is why they are true to their stories and also give social messages.

"conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than    million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.but while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the norwegian refugee council?s internal displacement monitoring centre. alexandra bilak, director of the idmc, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. ?not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you?re missing part of the picture,? she said. ?if you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,? added bilak.last year, an estimated  .  million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. worst affected was the democratic republic of the congo, where    ,    were displaced, a   % rise on the previous year. close behind was syria (   ,   ), followed by iraq (   ,   ), afghanistan (   ,   ), nigeria (   ,   ) and yemen (   ,   ).disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing   .  million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. this trend was at its most acute in east asia and the pacific. in china,  .  million were forced from their homes, with  .  million affected in the philippines and a further  .  million in india. floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. in some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report?s authors noted. it pointed to the situations unfolding in nigeria, south sudan and somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. bilak said the number of displacements due to violence in drc was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. ?unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.?in may last year, the un proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least   % by     . the report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.?what we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. we just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,? said jan egeland, secretary general of the norwegian refugee council.he said there is a link with refugees ? though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.six of the    countries that produced the most refugees in      ? afghanistan, colombia, drc, south sudan and syria ? were also among the    with the largest number of internally displaced people.egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. ?first, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,? he said. ?it?s incredible there?s not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the yemeni conflict. we also need to get economic life to countries like yemen and elsewhere so there?s not a collapse in social structures there. then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.?","more than    million people, that is one person every second, were displaced in their country in      because of conflicts, violence and natural disasters, a norwegian refugee council report has revealed. adding that the democratic republic of the congo was the worst affected country, the report said that natural disasters displaced over three times the number uprooted by conflicts.

"bt has been fined     m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated      m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections.ofcom found that bt broke rules put in place to stop openreach, its subsidiary that controls the uk broadband infrastructure network, abusing its ?significant market power? by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.bt said it expected to pay out      m in compensation to rivals including sky, vodafone and talktalk for the ?serious breach? of ofcom?s rules.?the size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses,? said gaucho rasmussen, investigations director at ofcom. ?our message is clear ? we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. millions of people rely on bt?s network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.?compensation must be paid to affected providers within    months, ofcom said.the record     m penalty, which was reduced from     m after bt admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than    times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by ofcom. last year, vodafone was fined    . m for taking pay-as-you-go customers? money without providing a service. bt?s fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the    . m itv had to pay in      over the ?abuse? of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows.ofcom?s investigation into bt focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between january      and december     . it was instigated after a complaint from vodafone, which relies on bt ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. vodafone accused openreach of failing to meet its   -day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation.?these high-speed lines are a vital part of this country?s digital backbone,? said rasmussen. ?we found bt broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.?bt was also fined      ,    for ?failing to provide information to ofcom?.?we apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections,?

"the   th chief of the indian air force (iaf), air chief marshal arup raha today addressed a press conference he termed as 'customary' for an outgoing air chief. though many from the press corps disagreed, it made for a candid interaction with the man who has been at the helm of not just the iaf for three full years but also was the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee (cosc), the apex tri-service body for nearly    months.key excerpts:iaf's fighter planes: the teeth of any air force is in its fighter planes. the government has allowed us    squadrons. as of now, we have a large number of sukhoi    (   squadrons inducted and three more will be done soon). we are doing a mid life upgrade and we foresee them to be around for the next    years. the light combat aircraft (lca) tejas is a good, fourth generation plus aircraft. the rafale is an excellent aircraft which will prove its worth in any scenario. we have just signed up for    planes. in the next  -   years time, we need more. one more line of aircraft production is required in india under the make in india program. need about     fighters over next  -   years. we have enough heavy fighters (like sukhoi) but we need more in the medium segment.worst moment: it came when i heard about the an   missing with    personnel. we searched a lot, undertook     sorties, over      flying hours. we had about    targets which look like the an   debris. we have underwater assets which can search till the depth of  . km from the surface. from   , there are now just    targets which remain to be verified. the underwater equipment to search could not do its job because there was a technical issue. we have approached the government to contract agencies from abroad who can search. most of the soviet era planes like the an   lack under water locator beacons. we have taken up with the government a case to procure such beacons. within a month or two, a contract signed to arm all planes with such beacons. i feel, the an   is not the best plane for this route. you can call it a mistake of not fitting these planes with the beacons.defence corruption: from time to time, issues have come up. the investigating agencies have not been able to pin down those involved. it is not only the armed forces personnel who are involved in procurement. it will be premature to say anything in the agustawestland case. that a former iaf chief has been arrested obviously has consequences and the law of the land has to be followed. however, an ex iaf chief is like a family member to us and till a person is convicted, let us give him his due. if convicted, there should be no sympathy.china reacting to agni v test: posturing will always be there. we should go about our task. unless there is something being done which is prohibited like nuclear proliferation which is also happening by the way in our neighbourhood, if we are legitimately developing our capability, i do not think anybody should object.on air to air refueling planes of the iaf: the aircraft we have for the job are not very good on serviceability. we need much more. unfortunately, anomalies came up and acquisition had been cancelled. very unfortunate but you can't help it.military diplomacy: we've done well. we convinced the government to step up military cooperation with nations in our neighbourhood, the saarc region, far-east. now the government is ready to sell them equipment too. this will help fill the void which our adversaries would have exploited.disaster response: we thought we may or may not fight a conventional war but we have to be there to serve our people. we have been the first responders in our international humanitarian missions. we have aided the governments be it during the jat agitation, running its mints   x  etc. we are also helping bsf, arc, paramilitary forces and anti-maoist operations.orop: the agitation was a setback. it affected the esteem of the armed forces. i could not stem the agitation. what the government has given is reasonably good. i have told my people to accept it. anomalies ought to resolved, including those from the seventh pay commission.post-pathankot: much has been discussed and we are implementing the lessons learnt. we are now well prepared to tackle terrorist attacks. a lot has been done in training, orientation, weapons are being improved, field-craft has been improved. we are training a large number of manpower. government has given us the authority to have    garud commando flights (each with    men) and    more have been sanctioned, taking it to total of    garud commando flights.","the outgoing indian air force chief arup raha on wednesday said the worst moment during his tenure was when he heard about an an-   plane going missing with    personnel on board. citing that the iaf undertook over  ,    flying hours to search for the plane, raha termed it as a mistake of not fitting an-  s with underwater locator beacons."

"""we have waited patiently till now. will do what is required after a point,"" grudged sasikala, after hearing that one of aiadmk's sitting minister k pandiarajan had jumped the ship. saturday was not favourable for sasikala as two mps met caretaker chief minister o panneerselvam and joined his gang. but the big blow for the day was jayalalithaa's loyalist k pandiarajan, who sasikala thought would replace thambidurai as the messenger between the state and the centre. all this occurred before the half day mark. ""though pandiarajan was expected to join panneerselvam long time back, sasikala's family members had persuaded him to stay back,"" stated an aide from poes garden. moreover, sasikala's camp lost a huge moral boost when madhusudhanan, the presiding chairman and one of the members of aiadmk from its origin went to the other side. also read: panneerselvam vs sasikala: huge blow to chinamma as minister pandiarajan joins ops campan enraged sasikala openly stated that the delay caused by the governor seems deliberate and hinted that as time goes by, her grip over the herded mlas was slipping.  but the way she framed the words to say that ""will do what is required"", it ended up more like a threat to the governor who still hasn't called her to form the government and less of a claim. giving out this statement, sasikala initiated an emergency trip to the resort where the mlas are 'kept' accompanied by her remaining generals, sengottaiyan and edapadi k palanisamy. the power paradeinitially, she wished to go to marina to pray at the jayalalithaa memorial before leaving to meet the mlas. but the trip was cancelled as cadres and sasikala followers could not turn up at the memorial in such a short time. jayalalithaa's 'land cruiser prada'  carrying sasikala took a different turn and left for 'kuvathur',   .   km from the city to 'golden bay resort', the private resort where    mlas are currently herded together. sasikala reached around  pm and the 'meeting' began. the initial plan was to take the mlas from the resort and to parade them in front of the governor to prove her strength. sasikala waited at the resort along with the mlas patiently to acquire the governor's appointment. ""we initiated the talks about meeting the governor but people around sasikala are not giving her the right advice. they did the same mistake they had done with her coronation attempt. they fix everything and then inform governor vidhyasagar rao doesn't act that way and she is not jayalalitha,"" explained a top government official. around  .  pm sengottaiyan, the most important general of aiadmk came out to inform that media is falsely stating that his name is on the card for the cm post.

""we have given a letter to the governor and we will wait till tomorrow evening,"" he said explaining that the governor has refused to meet sasikala for the day. the blackoutsources close to the mlas alleged that aiadmk mlas are not happy staying inside a resort as many were not prepared for such a vacation. also, there is a blackout of media inside the resort meaning they don't know what is going on in the world, which is why many have started to panic as well.around  .  pm, sasikala left golden bay resort holding a 'poker face' as any leak of expression would favour the opposite camp. reaching poes garden, she met the press and assured that everything is fine with the mlas and that they are her family and that they are together. also read: sasikala losing against panneerselvam? chinnamma unhappy with mlas, may withdraw from cm's racewhile cross-verifying with the ops camp, only his laughter was received as the answer since they claimed that the support for him had already crossed    yesterday itself. keeping all this in mind, sasikala expressed that, by sunday various other ways shall be taken to persuade the governor. also, interestingly while sasikala announced her plan, chennai police commissioner george too released a statement.

"popular bollywood celebrities like nandita das, taapsee pannu and tannishtha chatterjee have lent their support to national award winning actor nawazuddin siddiqui, who earlier slammed the entertainment industry for promoting racism.?thank you for making me realise that i cannot be paired along with the fair and handsome because i am dark and not good looking, but i never focus on that,? nawazuddin tweeted on july    while talking about the discrimination he has faced in the hindi film industry over appearance.after that a few bollywood celebrities have extended their support to nawazuddin and said that not only the film industry, but racism happens all over india.bollywood actors tiger shroff, nawazuddin siddiqui and nidhhi agerwal during an exclusive interview with ht city-hindustan times for the promotion of a movie munna michael.

"politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the eu?s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the french and dutch election campaigns.in its first decision on the issue of women wearing islamic headscarves at work, the european court of justice in luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on tuesday.the long-awaited ruling came on the eve of dutch elections, where muslim immigration has been a contentious issue. in france, where the race to succeed president francois hollande remains wide open, politicians on the right seized on the issue.francois fillon, the presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance on islam?s place in france, welcomed the judgment. on the day he was placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds he said in a statement that it was ?an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers?. he said the ruling would be ?a factor in cohesion and social peace?, particularly in france.gilbert collard, an mp for the rassemblement bleu marine, which supports marine le pen?s front national, claimed the ruling was an endorsement. ?even the ecj votes marine,? he wrote on twitter.in germany, the rightwing populist party, alternative fur deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: ?the ecj?s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for germany,? said the afd?s berlin leader, georg pazderski. ?of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.?the ecj issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from france and belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.?an internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,? the court said.it ruled that a company?s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.the first case was referred to the ecj by the belgian courts. samira achbita had been a receptionist for the belgian branch of g s, the london-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. achbita was fired in june      for refusing to take off her scarf. the company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.in the second case, asma bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an it consultancy firm, micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been ?embarrassed? by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. she had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company?s customers.in achbita?s case the ecj followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.?the court of justice finds that g s?s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. the rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.?in bougnaoui?s case the court?s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. she had been ?professionally competent? and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.the court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. it said customers? wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from eu anti-discrimination law. ?however, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer?s services provided by a worker wearing an islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.?the ecj did not rule on whether bougnaoui?s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the french court to determine.the german broadsheet suddeutsche zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how german courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since      had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. the ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the european court of human rights (echr) that allowed crosses to be worn.steve peers, a professor of eu law at essex university, said the latest ecj ruling looked awkward when set against the echr judgment that wearing religious symbols is ?sometimes an employee?s right to manifest freedom of religion?. he said the ecj had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.the echr is the high court of the   -member council of europe and not part of the eu. traditionally, the eu court in luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in europe?s single market, but its remit has grown as eu law has expanded.the ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. the conference of european rabbis, which comprises     jewish leaders across europe, said europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, pinchas goldschmidt, the group?s president, called on politicians to ensure europe did not isolate religious minorities.maryam h?madoun at the open society justice initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. ?it will lead to muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also jewish men who wear kippas, sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. it affects all of them, but disproportionately muslim women,? she said.stephen evans, the campaigns director at the national secular society in the uk, said: ?where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can?t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ?less favourable treatment?.?religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.?angelique chrisafis contributed to this report","employers may bar staff from wearing visible religious symbols, including women wearing islamic headscarves at work, european court of justice ruled on tuesday. however, customers cannot demand that workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, it stated. notably, this is the eu court's first decision on the issue of women wearing islamic headscarves at work."

a hit song of the   s from a film titled bomb blast. that was the last time we saw ronit roy dancing. here?s the video to remind you of how it looked.he shakes a leg again in munna michael after almost three decades, and that makes for a promising opening. his character believes michael (jackson, of course) lives forever, but getting thrown out of his dancing troupe, wavers his faith in dancing as a profession. so, he takes to drinking. this is what disillusioned artists do in bollywood. but that?s not all. he then finds an orphan in a dustbin and brings him home. because this is also what bollywood does.watch: our facebook live discussion on munna michael and lipstick under my burkhalike typical bollywood kids, this one too grows up to become munna (tiger shroff), a super dancer, in one song. his antics and need for money takes him to delhi where he begins teaching dance steps to mahinder fauji (nawazuddin siddiqui), a land shark and a closet dancer. their fine-tuned bromance goes for a toss the moment dolly (nidhhi agerwal) enters the frame. oh, we never saw that coming!just joking.now, it?s finally a film where everybody would look disinterested and jump at a chance to break into a song. why? because this is what bollywood does.some assistant must have reminded sabbir khan that it is      and the film is looking like the glossier version of the ?  s movies. so, he brings in the idea of dance face-off and a reality show. how would you fit in tiger shroff otherwise? how innovative!taking a cue from mj?s signature moonwalking to picking a dialogue from wong kar-wai?s chunking express, sabbir khan keeps trying to infuse munna with traits that can strike a balance between delhi and mumbai. it?s simple math. base the film in two biggest territories because that is what bollywood does. he isn?t done yet, but tiger shroff can?t bear the pressure anymore, so sabbir khan shifts his focus to nawazuddin, one of the finest of our times, and makes him do one of the most bizarre roles of his lifetime.hamming his way to hotel bluestar, a property he owns in delhi, siddiqui probably knows how it is going to look in the end. still he tries to not seem completely clueless. his efforts go in vein though. it?s sad to see him sleepwalking in munna michael after a top-class performance in mom.khan?s vision of making nawazudin siddiqui acrobats doesn?t help either. you can easily figure out the body doubles. even if you don?t, background dancers make sure you do. their close ups are so over the top that you would wander whether they all decided together to look in a certain way?talking of close ups, the award for most exciting close up goes to farah khan who judges a reality show in munna michael. her enthusiasm knows no boundary and every time tiger shroff does a summersault, you wait for farah?s ?oh my god? reaction.all this is happening because dolly wants to make her father proud by becoming an accomplished dancer. by the way, we never meet her father. she announces her arrival with these lines:hil jaande sab mere naal, jab main shake karaanfrom uk to nainital, sab shake karaan.it may sound like a conspiracy theory, but her striking similarity with kriti sanon might have prompted sabbir khan to cast her. sanon was the heroine of khan?s earlier film heropanti.her debut isn?t impressive, but you can?t signal her out. everyone, with special mention of pankaj tripathi, is equally out of touch in munna michael.mj should live forever, mj will live forever, but this isn?t the right tribute to the moonwalking king of pop. this forgettable    -minute film can be better described as this one-liner somebody whispered in the dark right before the end credits: ye sab alag hi zone me hain (they?re in a different zone).interact with rohit vats at twitter/@nawabjha","tiger shroff and nawazuddin siddiqui starrer 'munna michael', which released on friday, is ""a film where everybody would look disinterested and jump on a chance to break into a song,"" wrote ht. ndtv called it ""a mixed-genre monstrosity that never hits any kind of rhythm,"" while koimoi wrote, ""the script...lacks purpose"". it was rated  /  (ht) and  . /  (ndtv, koimoi)."

"the aadhaar hearing in the supreme court is fast turning into a right to privacy raised by the ""elite"" class versus right to life for millions of poor in the country. strongly backing the aadhaar scheme, the modi government on wednesday submitted before the supreme court that the right to life of millions of poor in the country through food, shelter and welfare measures was far more important than privacy concerns raised by the elite class. controversially, attorney general k k venugopal arguing for the centre also stated that privacy claims required better priority in developed countries ""not in a country like india where a vast majority of citizens don't have access to basic needs"". he said right to privacy cannot be invoked to scrap the aadhaar scheme. the government was categorical that after enrolling nearly     crore citizens spending an astronomical amount of rs  ,    crore there was no going back. 'aadhaar essential for good governance'the ag attempted to drive home the point that aadhaar was essential for good governance, transparent implementation of government programmes and to ensure that benefits reach only those who qualify to get them and not ghost beneficiaries. ""through aadhaar, benefits of welfare schemes reaches only those who are entitled to it. depriving large sections of people of food, shelter and welfare schemes is also depriving them of fundamental right to live. biometric details for aadhaar is essential for saving prople from animal existence"", venugopal told a nine-judge bench which is deciding whether right to privacy should be declared a fundamental right. at one point, justice d y chandrachud, who was part of the bench, interjected the ag saying privacy is not an elitist concern and it is equally applicable to the large masses. ""for example, if state wants forced sterilisation on say slum dwellers for population control among that group, perhaps only privacy claim may stand in the way"", said justice chandrachud.""privacy is ingrained in right to life and liberty...each one of them cannot be and need not be elevated as a fundamental right. it has to be on a case to case basis. privacy is just one specie like right to have passport, right not to be handcuffed they are various specie of public liberty"", argued venugopal.he also reminded the bench that ""world bank has said all countries must follow aadhaar- like model"".'transgression of individual rights'the bench is hearing pils filed by a retired karnataka high court judge k. puttaswamy, and social activist aruna roy against making the cards mandatory for accessing government schemes and subsidies.they argued that the manner in which biometric information is extracted violates and transgresses individual rights of citizens including privacy.the pils had said the manner in which biometric details are collected by private contractors and ngos hired by uidai without any safeguard makes them prone to misuse. they claimed empirical research to show that the biometric identification denoted for uid, namely the iris scan and finger print identification, is faulty and is capable of being abused.","the government told the supreme court that the right to life of millions of poor in the country is more important than the elite class' privacy concerns. it added that aadhaar ensures that benefits of various schemes reach those who are entitled to it. attorney general kk venugopal also said that aadhaar is ""essential for saving people from animal existence""."

"the largest ever study of cases of football players with the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (cte) has, again, found a link between the condition and ?prior participation in football?, particularly in professionals.the study looked at the brains of     nfl players and found cte in     of them, or   % of those studied.researchers at boston university and the boston veterans affairs health system examined the brains of     high school, college, semi-professional and nfl players for evidence of the disease. they found increasingly severe cte in players who had spent more time on the field. ?my hope is we?ll stop arguing about whether or not this is a problem, or whether or not it needs to be addressed,? said dr ann mckee of boston university. ?we need to take our heads out of the sand. it?s not going away because we want it to.? cte is associated with repeated blows to the head, including concussions. symptoms include difficulty with attention and memory, dementia, mood disorders and headaches. the players in the study had played football for an average of    years, and died at a median age of    years old. cte can only be definitively diagnosed after death.researchers found the most severe cases of cte in athletes who had played the longest, and at the highest levels. for example, the three high school football players identified with cte had mild symptoms, but the majority of college and semi-professional players (  %) had severe signs of the disease. eighty-six percent of professional players had severe cte. players with the most severe cte were also most likely to report clinical symptoms. of the    participants with severe cte,    (  %) had cognitive symptoms,    (  %) had behavioral, mood symptoms or both, and    (  %) had signs of dementia. researchers warned that their study can not be used to assess how many people who play football develop cte, because their sample was not random. the brains were donated by family members, most of whom said their loved ones had reported cte symptoms during their lifetimes. the former chicago bears running back mike adamle said he and others have formed a ?fraternity? of players who have suspected cases of the disease. ?the only thing i remember is he said, ?you have symptoms that are concurrent with cte,?? said adamle, about a clinical diagnosis from his doctor. ?we?ve got sort of a fraternity of players who just call each other up whenever we need it and for lack of a better phrase talk each other off the ledge ? you really do get paranoid and depressed.?cte was at first believed to primarily impact boxers, but in recent years it has increasingly become associated with football, hockey and military service. the nfl has for years been under sustained scrutiny because of the head trauma players endure. the nfl maintains that player safety is a top priority. however, as recently as     , a congressional investigation accused the nfl of seeking to influence cte research with donations to the national institutes of medicine. the nfl only acknowledged a link between degenerative brain disorders and the sport in     , after years of downplaying the links. the league also recently settled a class action lawsuit with players for $ bn. ?this is just the individuals who have come into our bank,? said mckee, noting it is unclear how many more players may have the disease. she said the need to be able to diagnose the disease while people are still alive is increasingly urgent. ?we need to bring them reasons for hope and optimism,? she said. in a statement to the guardian, the nfl said it welcomed mckee?s research. ?we appreciate the work done by dr mckee and her colleagues for the value it adds in the ongoing quest for a better understanding of cte. case studies such as those compiled in this updated paper are important to further advancing the science and progress related to head trauma. the medical and scientific communities will benefit from this publication and the nfl will continue to work with a wide range of experts to improve the health of current and former nfl athletes. ?as noted by the authors, there are still many unanswered questions relating to the cause, incidence and prevalence of long-term effects of head trauma such as cte. the nfl is committed to supporting scientific research into cte and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries.?",a research conducted on the donated brains of     nfl players has found that   % of them showed symptoms of a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (cte). the study also found that the disease was increasingly severe in players who had spent more time on the field.

"south korea has offered to hold rare military talks with the north to ease tensions after pyongyang?s first intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this month.monday?s offer, the first since south korea elected the moderate moon jae-in as president, came as the red cross in seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss the reunion of families separated by the     -   korean war.the south?s defence ministry proposed a meeting on friday at the border truce village of panmunjom, while the red cross offered to hold talks on   august at the same venue.if the government meeting goes ahead, it will be the first official inter-korea talks since december     . moon?s conservative predecessor, park geun-hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.the red cross said it hoped for a positive response from its counterpart in the north; mooted family reunions in early october would be the first in two years.millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the peninsula. many died without getting a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the heavily-fortified border, across which all civilian communication is banned. only about   ,    members of divided families are still left in the south. ?north korea should respond to our sincere proposals if it really seeks peace on the korean peninsula,? said cho myoung-gyon, seoul?s unification minister in charge of north korea affairs.cho stressed that seoul ?would not seek collapse of the north or unification through absorbing the north? and urged pyongyang to restore inter-korea communication channels, including a shuttered military hotline. moon, who took power in may, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed north as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table and vowed to play a more active role in global efforts to tame the south?s unpredictable neighbour.but pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of un resolutions, most recently on   july when it test-fired its first icbm, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by the us president, donald trump, to impose harsher un sanctions on the country.washington has also called on china, the north?s sole ally, to put more pressure on pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions, which have advanced rapidly under the north?s leader, kim jong-un. ?we make the proposal for a meeting ? aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,? the defence ministry said in a statement.[new]the european union offered european support for south korean efforts to negotiate with north korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.in a statement monday, the eu?s executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a ?serious threat to international peace and security? and urged an end to such actions.the latest missile test ? which kim described as a ?gift? to the americans ? was seen as a milestone in pyongyang?s quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the us mainland.the proposed meetings, if realised, would be a ?rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for    years?, said cheong seong-chang, analyst at the sejong institute, a thinktank.?it would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the north would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes,? he said. the agenda for the meeting could include moves to suspend propaganda campaigns operated on both sides of the border for years, cheong added. the south?s military has deployed dozens of giant loudspeakers along the tense border to blare out a mix of world news, k-pop songs and other propaganda targeting young north korean soldiers. it has also occasionally launched giant balloons containing anti-pyongyang leaflets across the border despite warnings of military retaliation by the north.the north has responded with its own propaganda broadcasts and sent anti-seoul leaflets via giant balloons across the border.  ","south korea has proposed military talks with north korea to ease tensions over the latter's nuclear and ballistic missile programme, for the first time under president moon jae-in. the offer by jae-in, who has vowed to achieve peace with north korea, comes after the reclusive state claimed to have test-fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile."
"fever-tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder charles rolls cashed in     m of shares.the sale left the company?s stock down  % at     .   on thursday ? but that is still nearly    times its    .   price tag when it floated less than three years ago.demand for the shares from city investors was so great that rolls offloaded  . m shares, a  . % stake, having initially planned to release  . m.he retains an   . % holding worth      m, and the company is valued at nearly    bn.that means fever-tree is worth more than britvic, its    -year old rival, more than the uk arm of domino?s pizza, and about three times as much as the debenhams store chain.that is astonishing for a business with sales of just      m and only    full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. but it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since rolls and co-founder tim warrillow launched it in     .from a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling     m of stock between them when they floated the company on the aim market in     . rolls has cashed out to the tune of      m, because he also sold a     m tranche of shares last year.he owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water ? or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. he once contracted malaria during a trip to africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company?s name, with saving his life.though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.it has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.its ginger comes from ivory coast and nigeria, its lemons from sicily, and warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the democratic republic of the congo.these are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of fever-tree in its mixer cabinet.indeed, one of the company?s early customers was world-renowned chef ferran adria, who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant el bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world?s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in     .posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the uk, spain and us. and premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.fever-tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to     . m on sales of      m.this month, the company announced that its      results would comfortably exceed city forecasts, indicating that the fever-tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.rolls, a former management consultant who revived the plymouth gin brand, and warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by schweppes of the mixers market.rolls had noticed that the world?s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. ?there?s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn?t right,? he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion?s share of a g&t, at least if it is made right.this year, rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.that might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.and with an extra     m in the bank, rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first g&t of the day.","charles rolls, the co-founder of upmarket tonic water maker fever-tree, sold a stake of around  % in the company for      million (around ?    crore). rolls cashed in the shares that have risen over   % this year alone and are currently up    % since its ipo in late     . after the sale, rolls still owns around   . % of the company."

""this means they can take long-term funds from institutions such as insurers and pension funds. insurance firms and pension funds need to invest certain portion of their money in infrastructure sector and the affordable housing now qualifies for those funds. ""the rera (real estate regulatory act) and these new measures will also stop the practice of builders taking full money in advance from the customers and then building the project entirely on the basis of customers money.

"allegations that british american tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in africa are being investigated by the serious fraud office, despite the cigarette company?s attempts to downplay the significance of a whistleblower who handed over a dossier of evidence.bat, now the largest tobacco company in the world after the recent merger with reynolds, has consistently denied the allegations of paul hopkins, whom it employed in africa for    years. when hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the sfo in december     , bat dismissed him as ?a rogue former employee?.the company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges.the sfo?s inquiries have now become a formal investigation. in a statement it said it was ?investigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by bat, its subsidiaries and associated persons?. it invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have.the news follows a major guardian investigation revealing that bat and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight african nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west.bat said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into hopkins? charges. ?we have been cooperating with the serious fraud office and british american tobacco has been informed that the sfo has now opened a formal investigation. bat intends to cooperate with that investigation,? it said.the company would not confirm whether the investigation concerned the allegations made by hopkins.he has claimed he paid bribes on the company?s behalf to the kenya revenue authority for access to information that bat could use against its kenyan competitor mastermind. hopkins also claimed that bat kenya had paid bribes to government officials in burundi, rwanda and comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations.bat hired the law firm linklaters in february      to conduct a ?full investigation? into the claims made by hopkins. bat later dropped linklaters and appointed slaughter and may as sole adviser on the case.louis charalambous, hopkins? solicitor, said bat had changed its tone. ?we note, with interest, that bat have abandoned their earlier pr strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,? he said in a statement.?paul hopkins blew the whistle during his time at bat and their internal team ignored him. previously bat tried to wriggle out by saying that mr hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. they also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims.?now their new external law firm and revised pr strategy are silent about mr hopkins. they need to go further and set the record straight. the company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.?hopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. ?i rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,? he said.deborah arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity ash, said: ?at the time the allegations of fraud in africa were first made against bat the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods.?eighteen months later and bat is having to admit it?s under investigation by the serious fraud office. the sfo must leave no stone unturned.?matthew myers, the president of the campaign for tobacco-free kids, called on the us government to also investigate bat. ?the allegations against british american tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,? he said.?as british american tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the united states, we urge the us department of justice to also investigate the company?s alleged misconduct.?the bat chief executive, nicandro durante, told the financial times in march that the firm would ?act in a very strong way? if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. he said: ?we are in     countries, so i cannot give a    % guarantee that everything?s going to go by the book.?the sfo investigation is another blow to the company, after the us health watchdog, the food and drug administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms.","uk tobacco company british american tobacco (bat) is being investigated by the serious fraud office (sfo) over allegations about involvement in bribery and corruption in africa. bat has denied allegations of a whistleblower who handed over multiple documents to sfo. however, bat has said it is cooperating with uk authorities as campaigners are now urging us government to act."

"the canadian government is investigating reports that saudi arabia is using armoured vehicles made in canada against its own civilians ? allegations that have prompted renewed scrutiny over ottawa?s recent decision to sign off on a billion-dollar arms deal with the kingdom.videos and photos posted on social media in recent days allegedly show riyadh using canadian equipment in a violent crackdown on minority shia dissidents in eastern saudi arabia. last week at least five people were killed as security forces flushed out suspected militants in the town of awamiya. several sources told the canadian newspaper the globe and mail that the vehicles being used appeared to be gurkha rpvs made in ontario by terradyne armoured vehicles. canadian officials said they were deeply concerned by the reports. ?we are looking at these claims very seriously ? and have immediately launched a review,? justin trudeau told reporters. in     , saudi arabia ranked among the largest importers of canada-made military goods, purchasing more than c$   m worth of goods ? nearly   % of all canadian military exports that year.the ministry of global affairs said it was concerned over the escalating violence in eastern saudi arabia. in a statement issued last week, it highlighted the causalities among civilians and security forces and urged riyadh to confront its security challenges in ?a manner that abides by international human rights law?.days later, the ministry said the government was actively seeking more information about the reports of civilian casualties and claims that canadian-made vehicles were involved. ?if it is found that canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights, the minister will take action,? a spokesperson for department told the guardian. he did not answer questions around what kinds of actions this could entail. terradyne armoured vehicles did not respond to a request for comment. the allegations have prompted renewed calls for trudeau?s liberal government to scrap a recent decision to push forward with a   -year contract to supply saudi arabia with weaponised armoured vehicles made by general dynamics, another ontario-based company. critics say the c$  bn deal, struck in      by the previous conservative government, could see the vehicles ? which are equipped with machine guns ? used by the saudis to crush dissent at home. others have pointed to canadian rules that restrict arms exports to countries with poor human rights records and prohibit exports if there is a possibility that the buyer could use the arms against its own population. despite these concerns, trudeau?s liberal government signed off on the export permits in     . trudeau has since defended the decision, arguing that canada would be seen as a ?banana republic? if it scrapped the deal. ?people have to know that when you sign a deal with canada, a change in governments won?t immediately scrap the jobs and benefits coming from it,? the prime minister told the toronto star last year. the deal would reportedly create around  ,    jobs in canada. amid escalating concerns over human rights, countries such as germany and belgium have in recent years denied export applications for arms headed to saudi arabia. in     , sweden cancelled a longstanding defence agreement with the saudis, citing similar concerns. this month, a high court in london ruled that the uk could proceed with arms sales to saudi arabia. ?saudi arabia has been, and remains, genuinely committed to compliance with international humanitarian law; and there was no ?real risk? that there might be ?serious violations? of international humanitarian law (in its various manifestations) such that uk arm sales to saudi arabia should be suspended or cancelled,? the court said. campaigners called the ruling a ?green light? for the uk to sell arms to ?brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers?.in canada, amnesty international pointed to the indications that canadian vehicles are being used against civilians to call on the liberal government to reverse its support of the billion-dollar arms deal.?mounting tensions and conflict in eastern saudi arabia, about which the canadian government has rightly expressed public concern, further indicate how fraught it is for canada to have authorised the sale of light armoured vehicles to saudi arabia at this time,? secretary-general alex neve said in a statement.

""}}but the virus had a side-effect. it made simians ? apes, chimps, monkeys of all sorts ? evolve quicker than they were meant to. soon, like most oppressed beings suddenly empowered, they fought back. they were led in that first battle by an ape named caesar, who had seen the compassion mankind was capable of, but also the cruelty.it?s been fifteen years since the fight on the golden gate bridge, a fight the apes won, but after which they were forced to leave the dangerous cities. caesar, battle-worn and scarred, has taken his apes, and his family, into the woods, where they lay in hiding, one eye always glancing over their shoulder for the last remnants of humanity to attack.word has travelled over the snowy mountains that a violent militia has been formed by a cruel man, a man who calls himself the colonel, like apocalypse now?s kurtz, utterly consumed by insanity. he has imprisoned hundreds of apes at his large compound, which lies at the foot of snowy, forested mountains. he makes them work, under his boot-heels, tamed to the sound of his whip. he has madness in his eyes, they say. a torn, tattered american flag hangs limply off his balcony, from where, like schindler?s list?s amon goth, he surveys his kingdom through a lens.he wants them to build a wall.war for the planet of the apes is the rare blockbuster that arrives once, maybe twice every year. in     , we haven?t seen a better one since logan, a film with which it shares several similarities ? a hero driven by duty, a mute young girl whom he must protect, and a sombre tone that will surely test the patience of some audience members. but that?s what made me like it more.with this, matt reeves has made his fourth, unquestionably great movie. his grip on the war movie tone, aided by stunning, almost biblically grand visuals and music by two michaels, seresin and giacchino, firmly establish him as one of the finest directors working within the studio system today. it might even be the first great post-human movie ? for more reasons than one. technically, because it signals the arrival of an era in cinema where human actors could quite possibly be made obsolete, and thematically, because it suggests that human beings are a scourge that needs to be destroyed.over the three films that span several decades, the planet of the apes reboot series tells an epic story of one creature?s rise, but it is also a shakespearean tragedy ? a cautionary tale that chronicles the slow death of an entire species: mankind.our hubris, it suggests, is the reason behind our downfall. we have been led to believe, ever since we were little children, ignorant and malleable, that we are the apex predators, that we occupy the throne at the top of the food chain. this is a lie. we are simply at that stage in the evolution of our planet at which we happen to be the most intelligent life forms living on it. faced with the prospect of billions of more years? worth of evolution, we could easily be overtaken by an even more intelligent species ? perhaps one of our own making.like bong joon-ho?s terrific okja, a film that could very easily be its close cousin, war for the planet of the apes harbours an unshakable contempt for humanity. and along with its immediate predecessor, the quietly brilliant dawn for the planet of the apes, it firmly believes that we are beyond redemption, and that the only thing to do is for us to gracefully die out.but what are we without our fighting spirit? what are we without our silly delusions and false confidence? it?s what makes us human, dammit! so foolishly, we fight, even in the face of inevitable defeat, without realising ? and this is crucial ? that more often than not, we are the villains. in this particular situation, that face of inevitable defeat looks like an angry ape?s.and what an intricate work of art it is. crafted by hundreds of immensely talented people, sculpted around a flawless central performance by andy serkis, a maverick and a maven. if this doesn?t get him an academy award nomination, then we must rally the troops, and like a bunch of apes, protest till they start firing arrows at our sides, yelling ?apes, together, strong,? till we die.watch the war for the planet of the apes trailer herefollow @htshowbiz for morethe author tweets @rohannaahar","science fiction film 'war for the planet of the apes' which released on friday, ""is the rare blockbuster that arrives once, maybe twice every year"", wrote hindustan times. times of india said, ""[it's] a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that balances action and special effects"", while mid-day described it as ""brilliantly-scripted"". it was rated  . /  (ht),  /  (toi),  . /  (mid-day)."

"may    was meant to be a memorable day for julie, a   -year-old girl in bihar's muzaffarpur district,    km north of the state capital patna. a beautician had visited her for makeup and julie was sparkling in her bridal attire.her house was all decked up, the pandit (priest) was there to chant sacred mantra and abhinay kumar, a   -year-old youth she was to tie the nuptial knot, was ready, though under duress. but, just when the marriage mantras were over, the police arrived; searching for the kidnapped groom after his parents registered a case to this effect. but as usual, the cops arrived late, and by the time the marriage was already over.they still wanted to rescue the groom but the bride and her family - backed with relatives and villagers - put up a tough fight, forcing the cops to beat a hasty retreat. the cops returned an hour later, angrier than before; and in greater number. they swung their batons with such ferocity that it left nearly two dozen men and women, including julie injured.now, a week later, with injuries all over her body, julie is still struggling to walk straight. the muzaffarpur senior superintendent of police vivek kumar has suspended gayghat police station in-charge rajesh choudhary, holding him responsible for excesses. the only positive outcome for julie in the entire drama was that her husband who was reluctant to marry her initially began to empathise, seeing her writhing in pain.""i have accepted her as my better half. whatever difference there is between our families, it will get over shortly. time will heal everything,"" he says.around  ,    kidnappings for marriage in      sounds like an unusual way to get married? in julie and abhinay's bihar what is bizarre is not the manner in which the couple walked down the aisle, but the police action that followed. surprisingly, this is nothing unusual in bihar as the state witnesses around  ,    couples getting hitched in the same style, almost every year. statistics boils down to nine such marriages a day.known as pakadwa vivah (marriage by abduction), the tradition is simple: zero-in on a prospective groom, kidnap him and make him tie the nuptial knot at gunpoint. and the numbers are in fact growing. bihar witnessed  ,    kidnapping for marriage in     . it was  ,    in      and  ,    in     . and a majority of these marriages survive.abduction for marriage appears to have remained unabated in      too. according to figures available with the police, bihar already has reported     kidnappings for marriage by march this year. on the other hand, only eight cases of kidnappings for ransom - which bihar was once infamous for - have been registered during this period.clearly, abduction for marriage is almost like an established, acceptable trend in bihar. the ncrb crime in india report,      report - which is the most recent official figure available at present - also confirms that while bihar is far below other states when it comes to abduction of boys below    years of age, it stands at the top in the country when it comes to abductions of above   -year-old males. in fact, the number of abducted males from bihar in the    to    age-group category was  ,    in     . the state alone accounted for nearly    per cent of the national figure in the category.""the abduction of boys for marriage is a direct consequence of social evils like dowry. it is a rearguard action from the bride's family, which finds itself under great material load while arranging the marriage. in a traditionally patriarchal society like bihar, marriages have become a money-minting enterprise for the boy's parents. so, families without wherewithal to arrange a decent dowry resort to desperate measures like abducting a suitable bridegroom for their daughter's marriage,"" says ashok priyadarshi, a teacher in nawada, a district infamous for such marriages.direct consequence of social evils like dowrythough illegal, dowry is an inevitable traditional marriage practice by which the groom's family demands enormous sums of money and goods from the bride's family as a condition for letting their son marry her.families resort to snatch men - often young boys- because it is easier than approaching boy's families and cheaper than paying the standard ""dowry,"" which is in lakhs plus a vehicle.kamta singh, chairman of a primary agriculture credit society in rampur, navada claimed that almost    per cent marriages in the village have been solemnised by kidnapping a bridegroom. a good number of boys are kidnapped and married off during matriculation and intermediate examinations when they visit the examination centres. in march, a   -year-old boy was kidnapped from patna and married off to a   -year-old girl shortly after he reached the city with a cousin who was appearing for matriculation examination. the boy, a class xii student, was whisked away by four men on two bikes after smothering him unconscious with a chloroformed cloth. by the time the boy regained his senses, he was inside a house with lots of people around, who told him that he was now married. his clothes too were changed into bridal attire.families often use friends and relatives, and sometimes even hire professional criminals, to carryout abductions for marriages. in may     , criminals assigned to kidnap   -year-old lalbabu for marriage, opened fire in gaya to terrorise a group of students, who were with the victim as he came out from a coaching centre.lalbabu's friend praveen received a gunshot and succumbed to his injuries. a shocked lalbabu was abducted by the criminals to a temple in jehanabad district where he was forced to marry a   -year-old girl babita under the shadow of a gun. the marriage, however, fell apart with the police registering murder cases against the bride's father and brother.security personnel too get kidnappedeven security personnel themselves can be kidnapped by the criminals. once, the bodyguard of a bihar cadre ips officer shivdeep w lande, now on deputation to maharashtra, was kidnapped when he was posted in jamalpur. but the kidnappers set him free after realising that they could invite a police backlash.once a boy is kidnapped and taken to a bride's home, his future in-laws try to calm him down by placing a wedding headgear onto his head. the embroidered headgear, called a mauri, is a symbol of his submissive acceptance. many fight fiercely, but every kidnapped boy eventually relents under duress. in almost all such cases, the villagers extend support to the girl's family. the ceremony is videographed so that the tapes can be used as evidence later.in fact, even priests of village temples - where marriages are solemnised, like in the case of lalbabu - cooperate with the girl's family and issue a certificate of marriage. clearly, the approval from society to such marriages has emboldened the families to take the law into their hands.the practice has technically been illegal for years, but the law rarely has been enforced. brutal as the custom is, it is widely perceived as practical.tale of three brothers kidnapped for marriage""most people don't care it's illegal because there is a very high possibility of reconciliation. the boy's family frets and fumes after the marriage but only to raise a dowry demand. assured that the boy is now theirs, the girl's parent are also willing to settle things by offering one-fourth of the usual dowry which they would have had to offer had the boy not been married,"" said hetukar jha a retired sociology professor at patna university.rajiv narayan of nawada in bihar is one of the numerous such men who has put the past behind and accepted his wife, with whom he was forcefully married in     . rajiv was tricked to visit badhaiya in lakhisarai district where he was married under duress when he was just   .he was married to madhuri devi, who was only   . their families allowed the two to complete their studies before the two were formally made to live together. today rajiv is employed as a meter reader with bihar electricity board while madhuri is school teacher at nawada.rajiv's younger brother ashok (   year), a lawyer, was married at the age of    in a similar fashion with annu of pakribaswan village. the youngest brother dhannjay was also abducted and married to sunita of bighawa village in     . dhananjay,   , now runs a computer hardware shop.","as per a report,  ,    grooms got married at gunpoint in bihar in     . the practice, known as 'pakadwa vivah', led to  ,    grooms getting married at gunpoint in the state in      and  ,    in     . according to police figures, bihar reported     kidnappings for marriage by march this year, and eight cases of kidnappings for ransom."

"india is called a land of vast diversities and as almost always, this monsoon is serving to show exactly how vast the diversity is. when large parts of northeast and west india are being inundated by heavy rains, causing property damage worth crores and claiming lives of men and animals alike, most of the ganga-yamuna plain area of uttar pradesh is parched due to lack of rainfall.farmers in the northeast have lost their crops to the heavy rains and in uttar pradesh, the farmers are afraid of losing their crops to the dry season. five districts of up, agra, pilibhit, muzaffar nagar, ghaziabad and noida are facing a serious drought that is showing no signs of lifting anytime soon.a senior administrative official told india today that out of    districts in up,    are yet to have decent rainfall in the monsoon season. farms are drying up in these districts, but out of these, the worst affected five districts are gearing up for contingency plans in case the monsoon decides to skip these districts altogether. the heat and humidity is making people fall sick and although the yamuna river is flowing with ample water to ward off any drinking water crisis, vegetable prices are shooting sky-high.the month of july ends in two days, but the monsoon clouds have overflown these districts, especially the western up, where    cities of    districts have seen very low rainfall. in east up,    out of    cities have not had satisfactory rains. the affected districts of western up include agra, oraiyya, badaun, bulandshehar, etawah, firozabad, ghaziabad, noida, jhansi, hamirpur, jalaun, jyotiba phule nagar, hathras, mahoba, mathura, meerut, muzaffarnagar, rampur, pilibhit, saharanpur, and etah.agra's neighboring district mainpuri has had    .   mm rains in july, etah has had    .  mm, firozabad has had    .  mm, while mathura has had only    .  mm rainfall. a meteorological department official told india today that the drought affected   districts have had seriously low rainfall this july.agra has had    per cent lower rainfall this year, with just    .  mm rainfall. the average for july is    .  mm. rampur lost    per cent of its annual rainfall and got only    .  mm rains compared to the average of    .  mm. noida got just    mm rains against an average of    .  mm, making a shortfall of    per cent. ghaziabad had    .  mm rains against    .  mm average, with a shortfall of    per cent. muzaffar nagar lost   % of its water, getting only    .  mm rains compared to    .  mm average. similarly, pilibhit too lost    per cent water this month, getting    .  mm rains against     mm average.commenting on the lack of rains in agra, social activist vishal sharma quoted a small verse ""shukr hai agra mein nahin baraste badal, mere sheher ko barish ki aadat nahin hai"". he said that although the dry season brings its own set of problems, it is a fact that agra is not equipped to handle rains that last even an hour, let alone an entire day. the civic amenities in the city are prone to failure in the event of heavy rains due to the lack of drainage in most of the city, as was witnessed a couple of years earlier when heavy rainfall caused vast property damage in the city and the municipal authorities struggled for days to clear the water-logging in the low-lying areas.sharma said that even this month, the rainfall that took place a couple of days back, claimed the roofs of several old houses in motikatra, nagla joshiyan and other parts of the old city, injuring a number of people. several houses were also cracked, although the rain was not enough to cause serious water logging. however, even   -   mm rainfall in a day would be enough to cut off most of the densely populated outer areas from the rest of the city for several hours, if not days.meanwhile, agra district magistrate gaurav dayal has instructed all sub-divisional magistrates and additional district magistrates of agra to prepare reports of the drought so that the compensation amounts could be decided for the farmers.also read:","agra has had   % lower rainfall this year, with just    .  mm rainfall, according to the meteorological department. five districts across up? agra, pilibhit, muzaffarnagar, ghaziabad and noida had seriously low rainfall and are facing drought conditions, reports said. noida received only    mm rains against the average of    .  mm, making a shortfall of   %."
