and- we take pride in the little things we do every day.each citizen of india is a nation builder. each one of us is a custodian of india's well-being and of the legacy that we will pass on to coming generations.- the armed forces that protect our borders and keep us safe are nation builders.- those police and paramilitary forces that fight terrorism and crime are nation builders.- that farmer toiling in the blazing sun to feed fellow citizens is a nation builder. and we must never forget that so much of our farm labour comprises  women.- that scientist concentrating tirelessly and    x   to send an indian space mission to mars, or invent a vaccine, is a nation builder.- that nurse or doctor helping the sick to recover and fighting disease in a remote village, is a nation builder.- that young person who founds a start-up and becomes a job creator is a nation builder. the start-up could be on a small farm, converting mangoes to pickles. or in an artisans' village, weaving carpets. or at a laboratory lit up by giant screens.- that tribal and ordinary citizen striving to preserve our ecology, our forests, our wildlife, to push back climate change and to advance the cause of renewable energy, is a nation builder.- that committed and driven public servant who works beyond the call of duty, whether on a flooded road, directing traffic; or in a quiet room, poring over detailed files, is a nation builder.- that self-less teacher who equips young children and shapes their destinies, is a nation builder.- those countless women who take care of families with so many other responsibilities, at home and work, and raise children to become ideal citizens, are nation builders.people elect their representatives from the gram panchayat to parliament. they vest their will and hopes in these representatives. in turn, the people's representatives devote their lives to the service of nation.but, our endeavours are not for ourselves alone. down the ages, india has believed in the philosophy of vasudhaiva kutumbakam - the world is my family. it is appropriate that the land of lord buddha should lead the world in its search for peace, tranquility and ecological balance.india's voice counts in today's world. the entire planet is drawn to indian culture and soft power. the global community looks to us for solutions to international problems - whether terrorism, money laundering or climate change. in a globalised world, our responsibilities are also global.this links us to our global family, our friends and partners abroad, and our diaspora, that contributes in so many ways across the world. it brings us to the support of other nations, whether by extending the umbrella of the international solar alliance or being first respondents following natural disasters.we have achieved a lot as a nation, but the effort to do more, to do better and to do faster should be relentless. this is especially so as we approach the   th year of our independence in     . what must also bother us is our ability to enhance access and opportunity for the last person and the last girl-child from an under-privileged family if i may put it so, in the last house in the last village. this must include a quick and affordable justice delivery system in all judicial forums.the citizens of this country are the real source of strength to me.i am confident that they will continue to give me the energy to serve the nation.we need to sculpt a robust, high growth economy, an educated, ethical and shared community, and an egalitarian society, as envisioned by mahatma gandhi and deen dayal upadhyay ji. these are integral to our sense of humanism. this is the india of our dreams, an india that will provide equality of opportunities. this will be the india of the   st century.thank you very much!jai hindvande mataram"" also read:ram nath kovind sworn in as india's   th president;

but we are transferring power from washington, d.c. and giving it back to you, the american people.for too long, a small group in our nation?s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.washington flourished ? but the people did not share in its wealth.politicians prospered ? but the jobs left, and the factories closed.the establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation?s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.that all changes ? starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america. this is your day. this is your celebration.and this, the united states of america, is your country.what truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.january   th     , will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.everyone is listening to you now.you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.but for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.this american carnage stops right here and stops right now.we are one nation ? and their pain is our pain. their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. we share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans.for many decades, we?ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry;subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;we?ve defended other nation?s borders while refusing to defend our own;and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america?s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.we?ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.one by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind.the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.but that is the past. and now we are looking only to the future.we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.from this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.from this moment on, it?s going to be america first.every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit american workers and american families.we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.i will fight for you with every breath in my body ? and i will never, ever let you down.america will start winning again, winning like never before.we will bring back our jobs. we will bring back our borders. we will bring back our wealth. and we will bring back our dreams.we will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.we will get our people off of welfare and back to work ? rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor.we will follow two simple rules: buy american and hire american.we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world ? but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones ? and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.the bible tells us, ?how good and pleasant it is when god?s people live together in unity.?we must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.when america is united, america is totally unstoppable.there should be no fear ? we are protected, and we will always be protected.we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by god.finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.in america, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ? constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.the time for empty talk is over.now arrives the hour of action.do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america.we will not fail. our country will thrive and prosper again.we stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.a new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.it is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great american flag.and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.so to all americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:you will never be ignored again.your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our american destiny. and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.together, we will make america strong again.we will make america wealthy again.we will make america proud again.we will make america safe again.and, yes, together, we will make america great again. thank you, god bless you, and god bless america.     .  pm gmt    :      the helicopter winds up. and leaves. they?re heading to the airport and thence to california, for family vacation. the trumps and pences stand on the steps, watching the helicopter go. updated  at  .  pm gmt       .  pm gmt    :      the trumps and obamas stand there. then they walk down the steps in formation. the obamas are hand-in-hand. their walking towards the helicopter, which sounded like it was running but the blades aren?t moving. the group waits for the veep motorcade to pull out. there go the obamas. hand in hand, walking to their ride. the trumps follow them to the steps. trump shakes obamas hand. he says something in his ear. it really does look like he says, ?i?ll call you.?

"washington, apr    (pti) inspired by the chinese and japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. despite the many advances in portable electronic devices, one thing remains constant - the need to plug them into a wall socket to recharge. portable electronic devices, such as watches, hearing aids and heart monitors, often require only a little energy. they usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries. researchers from georgia institute of technology in the us and chongqing university in china wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements. they have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (tengs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics. however, most teng devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy. researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit. the four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element. ","scientists have developed a lightweight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements. the inner surfaces are coated with gold and a carbon polymer film, comprising the electric nanogenerator. pressing and releasing the device for a few minutes charged the device to   volt, which was enough to power a remote control or a watch, researchers said."

she added: ?somebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired.? vandermeyden?s firing is likely to reignite debate over employment standards in silicon valley, where startups and major tech corporations are grappling with complaints of systemic wage disparities, gender discrimination and sexual misconduct.an account of alleged sexism at uber went viral earlier this year, fueling debate about harassment in the industry, while a recent federal lawsuit against google has placed a spotlight on concerns about tech firms underpaying women.  lawless, who represented the former reddit ceo ellen pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit, against the venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield & byers, said she intended to file a formal retaliation complaint on behalf of vandermeyden. ?it is illegal in the state of california for an employer to retaliate against an employee who asserts her rights, including her rights to receive equal pay as her male colleagues.?vandermeyden, who started working at tesla in     , claims in her lawsuit that she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over as a manufacturing engineer in the general assembly department.her complaint further alleged that she raised issues about flaws in the quality testing of cars that her supervisors and male engineers had missed. although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions over her, she alleged. the complaint said that she and other female engineers were denied promotions despite the fact that they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men.vandermeyden also alleged that she experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?.further, the lawsuit accused tesla of retaliating against her for speaking up. management allegedly told her that in order to advance her position, she would need to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was not expected of male engineers and was unattainable. although she had positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department, according to the lawsuit, which also said that tesla retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower?. tesla has continued to strongly reject vandermeyden?s claims. a spokesperson said the company had ?conducted a thorough internal investigation? and ?extensively re-reviewed all the facts?, repeatedly concluding that her allegations were false. tesla added that vandermeyden had been granted numerous positions ?over other more qualified candidates? and was ?given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications?.?the termination was based on ms vandermeyden behaving in what the evidence indicates is a fundamentally false and misleading manner, not as a result of retaliation for the lawsuit,? the spokesperson added. ?it is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner and therefore continued employment is also impossible.?the vandermeyden case is one of several labor issues that have dogged tesla, which is facing growing scrutiny over its practices in california. earlier this month, the guardian published an investigation into working conditions at tesla?s ?factory of the future? in fremont, california, where several factory workers complained about their treatment at the plant.incident reports revealed that ambulances have been called more than     times since      for workers experiencing fainting spells, seizures, dizziness, abnormal breathing and chest pains. a recent report from a worker safety organization found that tesla workers were injured at a rate   % higher than the industry average in     .the company has said it has significantly improved safety standards in recent months at the factory, and musk told the guardian he cared deeply about the health and wellbeing of his employees. vandermeyden, in her interview with the guardian in february, emphasized that she believed tesla was a ?revolutionary and innovative company? and said she took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the model s car.?until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she added. ?i?m an advocate of tesla. i really do believe they are doing great things. that said, i can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.?at the time, vandermeyden said she was hopeful her lawsuit and public comments would not end her career at the company. but she expressed some concern that her decision to speak out could result in retaliation. ?half the time when i walk into work,? she said, ?i wonder if my badge is going to work.?contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com","tesla has fired engineer aj vandermeyden who accused the automaker of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts. vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees. the company argued that she received special treatment at the expense of others, yet chose to ""pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing tesla."""

"donald trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son donald jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a      meeting with a kremlin-linked russian lawyer, a new report alleged on monday night.according to the washington post, trump personally intervened to prevent senior white house advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on   june      in which donald trump jr, the president?s son-in-law jared kushner, and then presidential campaign manager paul manafort came face-to-face with four russians. one of the russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer natalia veselnitskaya.the report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president?s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the white house because it draws trump himself much closer into the fray over the trump tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the russian affair.shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, trump reportedly dictated a statement on board air force one as he was flying back to washington from the g   summit in germany. as would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.in the release the      meeting was presented, in trump?s own words, as ?a short introductory meeting? dominated by discussion of the adoption of russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.that statement was presented to the new york times on   july, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. but within    hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.on   july, the times revealed that trump jr had been lured into talking to veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, hillary clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?i love it?.the trump tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between trump associates and russia in the kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the republican nominee. the special counsel leading the investigation, robert mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the white house to preserve all documents relating to it.until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the   june encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. but the new report that trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.it comes as mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired james comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the fbi to back off investigating former national security adviser michael flynn?s contacts with russian officials.a lawyer for the president issued the washington post with a curt statement: ?apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? jay sekulow said.the new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, anthony scaramucci, was dismissed from the white house after barely    days. the blunt removal was made on the first day of the new white house chief of staff, john kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the west wing has been sorely lacking.the day began shortly before  .  am with trump tweeting ?no wh chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?a great day at the white house?. but as the washington post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the trump tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.according to the post, senior white house officials together with the circle around kushner and his wife, ivanka trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the trump tower meeting publicly.kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency? because the whole truth would eventually come out.trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently.","us president donald trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son donald trump jr delivered on his meeting with a russian lawyer during the      presidential election campaign, according to a washington post report. in his statement, trump jr said he discussed the adoption of russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on hillary clinton."

""you cannot copyright a character. under american laws it can be, but they are redundant in india as a copyright over a character does not exist.""tuljapurkar also said that the character of fearless nadia was developed by homi wadia and his brother who wrote, directed and produced the films.

""it's like calling hema malini, the dream girl. the actor has played many characters but she is known as dream girl. now one cannot have a copyright over dream girl,"" said kadam. he added that the film is set at the time of pre-independence era. ""no claim can be made around historical facts. fearless nadia is a historic figure,"" argued kadam. he said the film is about a dancer julia who is in love with the director played by saif ali khan. she later goes to burma where she meets a soldier played by shahid kapoor, who is working for the indian national army and is on a secret mission.kadam accepted that the rangoon makers were in talks with the wadias for copyright on fearless nadia between      and     . emails showing the conversations between the two parties were perused by the petitioners.

"all india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (aimim) chief asaduddin owaisi has urged muslims to stand up in support of triple talaq, saying people of the community should draw inspiration from the way the tamils fought against the ban on hugely popular bull-taming sport jallikattu. owaisi said that like the tamils, muslims also have their own culture and they should derive inspiration from the tamil protests which he said made even prime minister narendra modi to bow down. owaisi added that nobody should interfere with their customs of marriage and triple talaq.""in tamil nadu, people protested in lakhs to fight for their tradition. modi had to bow in front of them. are we any less than them? we also have our own culture. we will marry and divorce the way we want to. nobody should direct us what we should do,"" owaisi said. owaisi's statement has come at a time when the supreme court is looking into the constitutional validity of triple talaq after several women's groups challenged the practice.why the controversywhile the allahabad high court termed triple talaq unconstitutional in december,     , the supreme court is separately hearing another plea filed by saira bano who has challenged the three rules related to niqah (wedding). these rules are: talaq-e-bidat, niqah halala and a man's right to have four wives.talaq-e-bidattalaq-e-bidat is the practice which gives a man the right to divorce to his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times without waiting for her consent on the matter.in the islamic tradition, some conditions were imposed for talaq-e-bidat. a man can divorce his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times during the period of a tuhar, that is, the time period of two menstruation cycles.this could be done in one sitting or spread over the specified period. under talaq-e-bidat, the wife's consent is not required for the separation.niqah halalathere have been instances where men have uttered 'talaq' three times in an inebriated state or in a fit of rage and have later wanted to revert to normal married life. however, the practice of niqah halala prevents the reversal of the triple talaq.according to the practice of niqah halala, a man is not allowed to marry the same woman after divorce even if both the partners are willing. such a niqah is considered haraam (illegal).niqah halala requires that the divorced woman marry some other man and after obtaining divorce from her second husband, she can remarry her first husband the second time.watch: owaisi urges muslims to fight for triple talaq the way tamils fought for jallikattu","all india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (aimim) chief asaduddin owaisi has urged muslims to stand in support of triple talaq just like the people of tamil nadu stood against the ban on traditional bull-taming sport jallikattu.

""this vaccine offers efficient, safe and affordable protection against chikungunya and builds the foundation for using viruses that only infect insects to develop vaccines against other insect-borne diseases,"" said scott weaver, professor at the university of texas medical branch at galveston (utmb) in the us. chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a disease characterised by fever and severe joint pain, often in hands and feet, and may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. some patients will feel better within a week but many develop longer-term joint pain that can last up to years. death is rare but can occur, researchers said. traditionally, vaccine development involves trade-offs between how quickly the vaccine works and safety. live-attenuated vaccines that are made from weakened versions of a live pathogen typically offer rapid and durable immunity but reduced safety. on the other hand, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of effectiveness, often requiring several doses and boosters to work properly. there may be a risk of disease with both of these vaccine types, either from incomplete inactivation of the virus or from incomplete or unstable weakening of the live virus that is only recognised when rare vulnerable individuals develop disease. to overcome these trade-offs, the researchers used the eilat virus as a vaccine platform since it only infects insects and has no impact on people. the utmb researchers used an eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine containing chikungunya structural proteins. the eilat/chikungunya vaccine was found to be structurally identical to natural chikungunya virus. the difference is that although the hybrid virus replicates very well in mosquito cells, it cannot replicate in mammals. ","in a first, us-based scientists claim to have developed a vaccine for chikungunya fever from an insect-specific virus that does not affect people. scientists used an eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine, which is structurally identical to the natural chikungunya virus. the hybrid virus can replicate in mosquitoes, but not in mammals."
"it is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of frank lampard and every chelsea fan ? particularly those who were there. bolton wanderers away;    april     . lampard surges around one opponent, cuts inside another and thrashes a low shot into the net.if chelsea win, they win the league title. for the first time since     . and in their centenary year, too. lampard has set them on their way and the celebrations that follow are frenzied. he is buried beneath a scrum of team-mates. even some of the substitutes jump on.lampard is not finished. on a quick break, he finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. he walks the ball around him to make it  - . game over. chelsea are the champions. lampard is a champion. not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.he was not finished. it was the second major honour of his career, following on from the league cup triumph in february of that year and lampard would go on to claim    of them ? all with his beloved chelsea, the club he joined from west ham united in     . the highlight, surely, was the champions league final in     , when he captained chelsea, in the absence of the suspended john terry, to the penalty shootout victory against bayern munich.now, lampard is finished. at the age of    and after    years in the professional game, he has decided to retire. he does so with three premier league titles to his name; four fa cups; two league cups; the champions league and the europa league. in other words, the clean sweep at club level.with england, it never went to plan, although he is hardly the only player who can say that. he was excellent at euro     , scoring three times as england reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the world cups of     ,      and      were disappointments.lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against portugal in      and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last    against germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ? except that the officials ruled it as no goal. it would have made the score  - . instead, england slumped to a  -  defeat.in many respects, it summed up how lampard?s international career, which yielded     caps and    goals, came down on the wrong side of the margins. it was shaped by his relationship in central midfield with steven gerrard, or the lack of one. the lampard-gerrard conundrum was debated endlessly.nevertheless, lampard goes down as a premier league great and he owes it all to his phenomenal work ethic and mental toughness; the desire that he has always had to prove his worth ? and others wrong.?when frank was a youngster, i can remember a lot of people saying: ?what?s all the fuss? he?s a good player but he isn?t that good,? says tony carr, the former west ham academy director, under whom lampard developed. ?he never got to play for england schoolboys and i can remember harry redknapp, the west ham manager, asking me why frank wasn?t playing for england youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.?harry rang the england coach, who was dave burnside, and dave said: ?we know about him but we think we?ve got better.? that sort of thing was a fantastic spur for frank. with his bloody?mindedness, his dedication, the way he constantly tried to improve himself ? he made himself the ultimate pro. i?ve got nothing but complete admiration for him.?as the tributes came in on thursday, the one from terry stood out. lampard?s long-time chelsea team?mate described him as a gentleman and a leader. but terry also made reference to how lampard had wrung every last drop from his talent. ?you were the best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,? terry wrote. ?you stayed out [after training] working on your finishing ?    goals a year wasn?t good enough for you; you wanted   ,    goals. i will miss you getting four cones and doing sprints after training ? setting the example for the academy kids.?lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only ryan giggs and gareth barry have made more premier league appearances than his     while his run of     consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. he read the game with intelligence ? this is a man who recorded one of britain?s highest mensa scores ? and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.in the end, though, lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution. he says the two at bolton were his best with the one he scored for chelsea at aston villa in     , which took him past bobby tambling?s all-time record for the club, not far behind.when lampard left chelsea in      to finish his career at manchester city and new york city, he did so with     goals from     appearances for them. it is doubtful whether the mark will be overhauled. in terms of the premier league, only alan shearer, wayne rooney and andy cole have scored more than his     goals and they, of course, are strikers.his numbers are mind?boggling and terry, tambling and others have described him as chelsea?s greatest player. his next move looks likely to be into coaching. whatever he does, lampard will give it his all.","chelsea and england legend frank lampard ended his   -year professional football career after announcing his retirement on thursday. the   -year-old, who scored a club-record     goals for chelsea, won a champions league title alongside winning three premier league titles with the blues. the midfielder won     caps for england and scored over     goals in his career."

"new delhi, aug   (pti) mobile industry body indian cellular association (ica) today criticised the business climate in india saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. ""ease of doing business...there are very few countries we can compete with, obviously from the bottom. probably, this is the worst country to do business in. that is a very frank statement i want to make,"" ica national president pankaj mohindroo said at an event organised by iamai. he said that igcr (import of goods at concessional rate of duty for manufacture of excisable goods) processes are very cumbersome in the country. ""there is no trust between customs authorities and taxation authorities. most ridiculous thing that i have ever heard is that there is target given for revenue collection,"" mohindroo said. he said that lack of ease of doing business is very upsetting to the industry. industry players raised concerns over huge capital getting blocked in bank guarantees given as assurance to customs that the items imported by them on concessional duty rates will not be retailed in the market and will be used solely for making mobile phones. as per data available in april, it is estimated that bank guarantees to the tune of rs   ,    crore have been furnished by companies. ajay kumar, additional secretary, ministry of electronics and it who was present at the event, countered mohindroos claim saying that there has been continuous improvement when it comes to doing business in india. ""india has jumped up several position in global indices released on ease of doing business. now, government gives    clearances in one day on e-biz portal for which people were required to approach similar number of offices. ease of doing business is a continuous improvement process and india is on right track,"" kumar said. the fast track task force, a joint government and industry body, has an objective to achieve production target of     million mobile phones by      and generate employment for    lakh by     . mohindroo, who heads the task force, said the target can be achieved only if india is able to match competitors like china and vietnam. ""china today is around    per cent of global manufacturing, which means it produces    lakh mobile phones per year. we are very elated that (mobile production) in india has reached rs   ,    crore, vietnam is already at   lakh crore. we have to match them in terms of direct taxes what vietnam and china are able to give,"" mohindroo said. he said that direct tax in china in special cases is around    per cent while in vietnam it is nearly zero. mohindroo said exports will play key role to achieve the target set by     million mobile phones production in india. ""pakistan does not permit indian mobile phones to enter pakistan, which is closest biggest market, and we have given most favoured nation to pakistan. this is not fair. i think commerce ministry has to take a lot of lead in this. bangladesh, sri lanka, nepal, also dont give us any credits,"" he said. ",indian cellular association president pankaj mohindroo on wednesday said that india is probably the worst country to do business in. he criticised india's business climate saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. he further said that lack of ease of doing business is very upsetting to the industry.

"from lalit k jha washington, feb    (pti) the adoption of the gst could help raise indias medium-term gdp growth to over eight per cent and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, the imf said today. at the same time, the international monetary fund (imf) also expressed concerns over the implementation of the goods and service tax (gst). ""although some uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the gst, its adoption is poised to help raise indias medium-term gdp growth to above   per cent as it will create a single national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-indian movement of goods and services,"" the imf said in its annual country report on india. the imf said larger than expected gains from the gst and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth, while a sustained period of continued low global energy prices would also be beneficial to india. noting that indias tax revenue-to-gdp ratio (at around    and a half per cent) remains considerably below than its emerging market peers, the imf said the implementation of a robust gst should be a key priority given its growth-enhancing effects. ""the gst should have minimal exemptions, uniform cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible,"" it said. key production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors, the imf said. rationalisation of the structure of direct taxes toward a lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should continue, it said. efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. according to the imf report, indian authorities were confident that the outstanding issues related to gst implementation could be settled promptly. ""the gst would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. tax reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate from    to    per cent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax deductions,"" it said. the gst replaces a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services. ","the adoption of gst could help raise india's medium-term gdp growth to over  % and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, imf has said. further, imf said that the implementation of a robust gst regime should be a key priority for the country, given its growth-enhancing effects."

"donald trump jr has been forced to release damning emails that reveal he eagerly embraced what he was told was a russian government attempt to damage hillary clinton?s election campaign.the stunning disclosure raised questions over whether campaign laws were broken and why senior trump associates failed to report a hostile act by a foreign power.trump jr also admitted on tuesday night that he could have handled the situation better but he had not told his father about meeting a russian lawyer because ?it was a nothing?.the emails show music promoter rob goldstone telling the future us president?s son that ?the crown prosecutor of russia? had offered ?to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father?.british-born goldstone adds in the exchange of   june     : ?this is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of russia and its government?s support for mr trump.?seventeen minutes later, trump jr welcomes this with the reply: ?if it?s what you say, i love it, especially later in the summer.?in a later email, goldstone describes the russian lawyer they are due to meet, natalia veselnitskaya, as a ?russian government attorney?.natalia veselnitskaya is the russian lawyer who met with donald trump jr, jared kushner and paul manafort at trump tower on   june     . trump jr has published emails showing veselnitskaya was introduced to him as a ?russian government attorney? who had damaging information about hillary clinton.veselnitskaya is a defence lawyer based just outside moscow, whose main client in recent years has been denis katsyv, a businessman accused of profiting from a major tax fraud uncovered by lawyer sergei magnitsky. she fought his case in us courts and mounted a pr campaign to try to clear katsyv?s name and overturn the ?magnitsky act? sanctions against russian officials that followed.veselnitskaya is not a government official and portrays herself as a lawyer with a private client. the question, then, is how she was able to secure the meeting at trump tower during a presidential campaign and why she was introduced to trump jr as representing the russian government.trump jr agrees, adding that he would probably be accompanied by ?paul manafort (campaign boss)? and ?my brother-in-law,? jared kushner, husband of trump?s daughter ivanka and now a senior white house adviser.the formatting of the emails suggests that trump jr forwarded the whole chain to manafort and kushner before the meeting the three attended with veselnitskaya at trump tower in new york on   june.on sunday, trump jr had said he had asked manafort and kushner to attend but not told them what the meeting was about. an associate of manafort said on tuesday that the former campaign chairman claims not to have read to the bottom of the chain of emails forwarded to him and kushner by trump jr about the meeting. jamie gorelick, an attorney for jared kushner, did not respond to questions about whether kushner read the emails and why he attended the meeting.critics seized on the new disclosures to question why three of trump?s closest advisers were willing to accept such a meeting instead of alerting authorities to interference by a foreign adversary. special counsel robert mueller and the house and senate intelligence committees are investigating russian meddling in the election, thought to include stealing democratic national committee emails and the use of social-media bots to spread fake news about clinton.my son is a high-quality person and i applaud his transparency.trump jr has offered shifting explanations for the meeting in recent days. in an interview broadcast on conservative fox news on tuesday night, he again sought to justify his motives but conceded that he could have handled the situation better.?in retrospect i probably would have done things a little differently,? he told interviewer sean hannity. ?again this is before the russia mania, this is before they were building this up in the press.trump jr denied that he told his father about the meeting. ?it was just a nothing,? he added. ?there was nothing to tell. i mean, i wouldn?t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. it was literally just a wasted    minutes, which was a shame.?trump spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders read a short statement from the president at the regular white house press briefing. ?my son is a high-quality person and i applaud his transparency.?she then refused to answer several questions on the matter, saying they must be directed to trump jr?s legal counsel and outside counsel.asked about the president?s reaction to the unfolding drama, huckabee sanders replied: ?i think the president is, i would say, frustrated with the process, the fact this continues to be an issue and he would love for us to be focused on issues like the economy, healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure.?clinton?s running mate tim kaine, a senator from virginia and member of the foreign relations committee, told msnbc: ?these emails are explosive. this should have set off alarm bells and red lights, and yet what it seemed to do is activate their salivatory glands. this is just wheelbarrows of new evidence for the special counsel and the senate intelligence committee.?trump jr released the email chain on tuesday apparently to pre-empt its publication by the new york times, which, this weekend, first broke the news of his meeting with veselnitskaya in june last year. veselnitskaya had promised compromising information about clinton but apparently failed to deliver.in a statement posted to twitter, trump jr explained: ?to everyone, in order to be totally transparent, i am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with rob goldstone about the meeting on june  ,     . to put this in context, this occurred before the current russian fever was in vogue.?there is no such position as crown prosecutor of russia, but the most likely candidate would be the long-serving prosecutor general, and a long-standing member of vladimir putin?s elite, yuri chaika.goldstone told the wall street journal his reference to the ?crown prosecutor? was meant to mean veselnitskaya. ?it?s a language thing,? he said. he referred questions from the guardian to his lawyer.trump jr has given varying reasons for why he accepted the meeting, first claiming it was to discuss american adoptions of russian children, then acknowledging that he was interested in information about clinton.the president?s eldest son denies any wrongdoing and tweeted on tuesday: ?media and dems are extremely invested in the russia story. if this nonsense meeting is all they have after a year, i understand the desperation!?goldstone told the associated press on monday he set up the meeting on behalf of a client, pop star emin agalarov, the son of a moscow-based developer, aras agalarov, who has close ties to putin and tried to partner with trump in a hotel project.aras agalarov worked with donald trump to bring the miss universe contest to moscow in     . trump appeared in a music video with emin agalarov that featured several miss universe contestants.goldstone?s   june email says the russian government?s support for trump is ?helped along by aras and emin?. he asks if trump jr wants to speak to emin about it directly and proposes: ?i can also send this info to your father via rhona? ? presumably rhona graff, donald trump?s longtime executive assistant ? ?but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.? it is not clear from the emails whether goldstone did send any of the information to trump sr, who has denied all knowledge of the meeting through his lawyer. before the publication of trump jr?s emails, veselnitskaya had denied she had gone to the meeting with information about the clinton campaign. ?it?s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information, they wanted it so badly,? she told nbc, denying that she had any to offer. she also answered ?no? when asked if she had ever worked for the russian government.later, sergey kislyak, the russian ambassador to the us, dismissed the significance of the trump jr meeting. ?i don?t think anything about it and to be honest there are more serious things to be think about in relation to russia,? he told the guardian at a us-russia business council farewell reception in washington.trump jr was at trump tower in new york on tuesday, according to a police officer at the building.eric trump, donald jr?s brother, was spotted in the lobby at around  .  pm with his wife lara. asked by the guardian if he had any comment on his brother?s emails or knew goldstone himself, eric trump did not respond. he then headed quickly to a gold elevator and headed upwards, staring silently ahead.the revelations around   -year-old trump jr?s involvement is one of the biggest blows yet in the saga of the trump campaign?s alleged ties to russia, which the president has dismissed as a ?hoax?.republicans on capitol hill were taken aback but reluctant to weigh in just yet. at least two republicans on the senate intelligence committee, senators john cornyn and james lankford, said trump jr should testify before the panel, which is overseeing one of three parallel investigations into russian interference in the us election.john mccain, a frequent critic of the trump administration, said there were ?many allusions and many stories of meetings and communications?, while noting he expected there was more yet to come.richard burr, the republican chief of the senate intelligence committee, said it was ?too early to draw any conclusions?.burr?s democratic counterpart, mark warner, said it was significant that the emails had been forwarded to kushner and manafort.?they?ve got a lot of explaining to do, because all these denials of any knowledge of russian government involvement seems to be a gross contradiction here,? warner told roll call.some of trump?s most ardent defenders nonetheless stood by the president. senator ted cruz of texas, who competed bitterly against trump for the republican nomination, blamed the media for fixating on russia.?russia is a significant adversary,? he told reporters. ?part of the irony of this media obsession with russia is that the obama administration began with hillary clinton bringing the big reset button with russia.norm eisen, former ethics czar under president barack obama, said: ?it?s another significant step forward in the investigation of trump collusion with russia because it represents an offer to collude and an acceptance of collusion to harm the campaign of hillary clinton and intrude upon our democracy.?he added: ?i believe it?s potentially legally actionable but we need to let the investigation play out. i predict it will not be the last bombshell.?additional reporting by shaun walker in moscow and oliver laughland and jon swaine in new yorkhere's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x   r n lqhere is page   (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z xi nr gq","us president donald trump's son donald trump jr on tuesday released emails showing he was offered ""sensitive"" information on hillary clinton by a russian lawyer before the us presidential elections. trump jr was reportedly informed ahead of a meeting with the lawyer that the information was part of an effort by the russian government to help the trump campaign."

"the global tiger day was created to think of the needs of a wild tiger. sadly we have forgotten this primary objective. what i am going to do is to spell out the indian tiger?s wishlist in the hope that those that engage with tigers will rethink and review their strategies.the most important item on the wishlist is to see a mindset change in the national tiger conservation authority (ntca) where this specially created institution starts to imbibe field wisdom about wild tigers through innovative strategies on both protection and tourism. tigers love well-managed visitors. they keep the forest staff on alert and can provide vital information on illegal grazing, wood felling and poaching. after all, there are hundreds of more eyes and ears looking and hearing. in places where tourism is low, tigers have suffered hugely. the ntca must learn to respect site-specific initiatives of state governments that can through tourism revenue make our tiger reserves self sufficient. this in turn provides field directors to undertake vital protection work without bureaucratic delays. the ntca in the last decade has discouraged tourism and endlessly interfered with state government policy seriously impacting the health of tigers. managing tigers is a state subject and the ntca must be in the role of facilitator and not policeman.the chief wildlife wardens of the states are vital to the tigers? wishlist. they need to take bold and innovative decisions that inspire the field staff. they need to engage with local communities in the effort to protect tigers. they need to ensure that all vacant positions are filled and chief ministers engaged with all the issues that confront wild tigers. state-of-the-art training is an essential element in the quality of governance that is needed to protect tigers. retired army officers can instruct on field craft, retired intelligence officials on gathering intelligence on poachers and their syndicates. our country can offer the best talent to secure the future of wild tigers. inter-state cooperation is vital to good governance and even more important than linking up with the central government. rajasthan has held such a meeting with maharashtra so that both can imbibe best practices from each other. choose forest staff with care. good decisions are made by those who spend time understanding tigers. ignorant decisions damage the future of tigers. the four or five big ngos must revitalise their thinking and prevent duplication. focus on specific trouble spots and solve problems with tactical help to the forest staff. do not beat your own drum. partner with local communities. the future of tigers will lie in how communities engage in protection. the time for sweet talking them is over. gather the young and train them into tiger protectors.all this requires strong political will. tigers need chief ministers at their side. their instructions are vital to innovative initiatives and this is where strong partnerships between the government and non-governmental sector can trigger the necessary political will. frequent meetings of the state board of wildlife that chief ministers chair are vital to resolving the tigers? problems.the prime minister of the country must play his role for the sake of our national animal. the prime minister chairs the national board for wildlife and frequent meetings are a must. the full board has not met for four years. this is the moment to meet and the best experts must apprise the prime minister of the tigers? needs.these are the five points on the wish list of india?s wild tigers. and who says it is not possible? rajasthan has shown the way. under the supervision of the chief minister, the ranthambhore tiger reserve has shown the highest amount of tigers ever now touching    with the highest tourist revenue now touching   million dollars just on entry ticket revenue. it has some of the best local community monitoring and protection and a genuine partnership with field forest staff. it has the best tourism practices and regular monthly meetings of an empowered committee that reports back to the chief minister. for the first time ever, extra tourism revenue is going to new tiger habitats that suffered tremendously due to limited funds.where there is a will there is a way. it is up to all of us to make it the day of the tiger.valmik thapar has worked for    years with wild tigers. he has also written    books on india?s tigers and wildlife","the international tiger day, an annual celebration to promote a system for protecting natural habitats of tigers and to raise public awareness for tiger conservation, is celebrated worldwide on july   . it was first observed in      at the saint petersburg tiger summit. reportedly, the world has lost   % of all wild tigers in a bit over     years."

"tokyo, feb    (pti) scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. efforts are currently underway around the world to create materials that are friendly to both society and the environment. among them are those that comprise different materials, which exhibit the merits of each component. researchers from hokkaido university in japan focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels. though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. to address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics. researchers found that a combination of polyampholyte (pa) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed earlier, and glass fibre fabric with a single fibre measuring around    micrometres in diameter produced a strong, tensile material. the procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in pa precursor solutions for polymerisation. when used alone, the fibre-reinforced hydrogels developed by the team are    times tougher than glass fibre fabric, and     times tougher than hydrogels - in terms of the energy required to destroy them. combining these materials enables a synergistic toughening. the team theorises that toughness is increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fibre and hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fibres toughness increases in relation to that of the hydrogels. consequently, the newly developed hydrogels are   times tougher compared to carbon steel. ""the fibre-reinforced hydrogels, with a    per cent water level, are environmentally friendly,"" said jian ping gong, from hokkaido university in japan. ","japan-based scientists have created a highly flexible material, five times tougher than carbon steel, by combining hydrogels with glass fibre. the reinforced hydrogel contains   % water and is environment-friendly. the flexible material could be used in manufacturing, fashion, and even making artificial human body joints, which are subject to strong load-bearing tensions, researchers said."

"a group of five men allegedly broke open an atm of central bank in acharya niketan market in east delhi?s pandav nagar area on friday, but had to flee without the money. police said that the theft was foiled by two constables who spotted the men while on patrolling. after being spotted, the men opened fire at the two policemen and managed to escape. luckily, the bullets did not hit the policemen. according to the police, the five men came to the central bank atm around  am in a honda city car. they parked the car outside and went in. the men allegedly covered the cameras installed inside the atm with a cloth and started breaking the machine. ?while two of them were inside, the other three kept watch outside. while they were taking the cash tray out, two policemen on patrolling duty crossed the atm and saw the men breaking the atm open. they reacted immediately and parked their bike to a side,? a senior police officer said. on seeing the policemen, the men outside alerted the their aides inside and whipped out pistols. they even fired two rounds to scare the police away. ?the policemen, however, chased the two men who were inside the atm, but they managed to escape. the other three, too, manged to flee with their car,? a police officer said. the police have registered a case against the men and have started to conduct raids to arrest them. ?based on a statement by the two policemen, we have registered a case. raids are on. we have identified two of the suspects and they will soon be arrested. we have also accessed the cctv footage from the cameras installed in and around the atm,? a police officer said.","two delhi police constables were shot at while trying to stop an atm theft by five men in delhi's pandav nagar on friday. after spotting the policemen, the three men outside alerted two of their aides inside the atm and opened fire to scare the constables away, but no bullets hit them. the men managed to escape, but without money."
"washington, jun    (pti) inspired by the nanostructures found on moth eyes, scientists have developed a new anti- reflection film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. the film exhibits a surface reflection of just  .   per cent, much lower than the iphones surface reflection of  .  per cent, for example. reflection is the major reason it is difficult to read a phone screen in bright sunlight, as the strong light reflecting off the screens surface washes out the display. ""using our flexible anti-reflection film on smartphones and tablets will make the screen bright and sharp, even when viewed outside,"" said shin-tson wu from the university of central florida in the us. ""in addition to exhibiting low reflection, our nature- inspired film is also scratch resistant and self-cleaning, which would protect touch screens from dust and fingerprints,"" said wu, who led the study published in the journal optica. the new film contains tiny uniform dimples, each about     nanometres in diameter (about one-thousandth of the width of a human hair). the coating can also be used with flexible display applications such as phones with screens that fold like a book, which are expected to hit the market as soon as next year. many of todays smartphones use a sensor to detect bright ambient light and then boost the screens brightness level enough to overcome the strong surface reflection. although this type of adaptive brightness control can help improve readability, it also drains battery power. other methods for solving the sunlight visibility problem have proved difficult to implement. looking for a simpler approach to improve screen readability outside, the researchers turned to nature. the eyes of moths are covered with a pattern of antireflective nanostructures that allow moths to see in the dark and prevent eye reflections that might be seen by predators. the researchers developed a fabrication technique that uses self-assembled nanospheres to form a precise template that can be used to create the moth-eye-like structure on a coating. ","researchers at the university of central florida have developed an anti-glare film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. the coating is inspired by the nanostructures that cover moth eyes and prevent light from reflecting off them. the flexible, self-cleaning coating increases readability by up to    times in different lighting conditions."

"a suspected british prankster appears to have conned white house officials including anthony scaramucci into replying to him after pretending in email correspondence to be several different members of the trump team.the man, who goes by the twitter handle @sinon_reborn, posed as jared kushner well enough to convince homeland security adviser tom bossert to reply to him, according to cnn. bossert included his personal email address in the exchange.named director of communications after having been denied a white house role earlier, the new york financier and republican fundraiser promptly threatened to fire everyone in his team over leaks. he also staged a combative and contradictory briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about suspiciously liberal pronouncements in his past and support for trump?s republican enemies; deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, reince priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of americans to lincoln?s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, priebus and steve bannon down the phone to a new yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son; saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.trump?s first national security adviser ? one of four generals the president has employed ? resigned after it was revealed he misled vice-president mike pence over his contacts with russians during the election campaign. it was later reported that yates had warned the white house flynn was vulnerable to russian blackmail.the most shocking firing of them all. trump sacked his fbi director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between trump aides and russia gathered pace. lest anyone retain any doubt about why trump pressed the big red button, he told nbc in a primetime interview the firing was tied to ?this russia thing?. the reverberations will be felt for some time yet.the long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president handed in his resignationin response to scaramucci?s appointment. a republican insider and priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after an infamous debut in which he angrily insisted trump?s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. achieving by way of melissa mccarthy?s lethal saturday night live impression a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the white house were long rumoured to be numbered. his departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only    days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.the former republican national committee chair stayed loyal ? at least in public ? to trump through friday, when he was told his time was up. he stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with cnn and, of course, fox news. but it seemed priebus?s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of scaramucci, which enraged the mooch, or by his closeness to the house speaker, paul ryan, than by his private advice to trump to quit the presidential race after   october, when the infamous access hollywood ?gropegate? tape was published. the washington post reported that priebus was thus never considered a member of the ?oct  th coalition?, a name for the inner cabal of trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss?s reputation has sunk.the man also fooled scaramucci, the white house communications director who was fired on monday, by pretending to be reince priebus, the former trump administration chief of staff with whom he was believed to be in open warfare.in a series of emails, the man posing as priebus baited scaramucci, accusing him of being ?breathtakingly hypocritical?

says pedro faria, technical director at environmental non-profit cdp, which published the report in collaboration with the climate accountability institute. traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change. the report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since      ? the year the intergovernmental panel on climate change was established ? can be traced to just    corporate and state-owned entities. the scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report. exxonmobil, shell, bp and chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since     . if fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next    years as they were between      and     , says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by  c by the end of the century. this is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.while companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says faria, the barrier is the ?absolute tension? between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.a carbon tracker study in      found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $ tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables ? in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.cdp says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. a fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. ?that puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,? says faria.investors should move out of fossil fuels, says michael brune, executive director of us environmental organisation the sierra club. ?not only is it morally risky, it?s economically risky. the world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.?there is a ?growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,? says brune. nearly     companies including apple, facebook, google and ikea have committed to    % renewable power under the re    initiative. volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from     . and oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. shell set up a renewables arm in      with a $ . bn investment attached and a spokesperson for chevron says it?s ?committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions? and is investing in two of the world?s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. a bp spokesperson says its ?determined to be part of the solution? for climate change and is ?investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.? and exxonmobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage.but for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. a research paper published last year by paul stevens, an academic at think tank chatham house, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a ?nasty, brutish and short? end within the next    years if they did not completely change their business models. investors now have a choice, according to charlie kronick, senior programme advisor at greenpeace uk. ?the future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops??","just     companies have been the source of   % of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since     , according to a carbon majors report. the report further claims that half of the emissions were traced to    state-owned fossil fuel producers. if the current fossil fuel extraction trend continues, global average temperatures would rise by  oc by     , the report warns."

"from sa re ga ma pa lil champs to the voice, sabse bada kalakaar to junior masterchef india and super dancer, reality shows featuring children are a common feature on indian television.last week, filmmaker shoojit sircar, known for films like piku, pink and madras cafe, tweeted that authorities should ban reality television shows for children. the tweet got close to   ,    likes and was retweeted over  ,    times, reigniting a long-standing debate. other voices joined the debate, including filmmaker amol gupte, who worked with child artistes in taare zameen par, and protested against the long working hours and exploitative conditions.humble request to authorities to urgently ban all reality shows involving children.it's actually destroying them emotionally & their purity.? shoojit sircar (@shoojitsircar) july  ,     reality shows are sold as platforms to discover and showcase the latent talent of children. parents and children from differing socio-economic backgrounds are attracted to the idea of a dream launchpad. in india, the success stories of singers sunidhi chauhan and shreya ghoshal, who were discovered as child artistes on reality shows, are the benchmarks that every parent with a talented child aspires towards.sunidhi was    when she won india?s first singing reality show on doordarshan, meri aawaz suno. ?the year was      and it was pure competition,? reminisces sunidhi. but her opinion of today?s reality shows is decisive: children are ?exposed to so much, so soon?. ?i would never want my children to go through this,? says sunidhi, who has judged contestants on leading singing shows like indian idol and the voice. ?i don?t think it?s required for any reality show to make children do things that only older people would do. they don?t need to mature ahead of their age,? she says. in the name of showcasing talent, ?cuteness? becomes a saleable factor, blurring the line between precocious and inappropriate. for shekhar ravjiani, one half of the music composer duo vishal-shekar, and a judge on indian idol junior season one (    ) and the voice india kids (    ), singing show sa re ga ma pa back in      was his first break. while he doesn?t advocate an all-out ban, there are concerns.?some shows encourage children to dress and behave like adults and that to me is jarring,? says shekhar. ?it takes away their purity, simplicity and most importantly their innocence and makes them aware of things that don?t matter at all.?behind the scenesreality shows featuring children have been around for a long time, but the pressures involved have changed. when sunidhi participated in meri awaz suno more than two decades ago, there was no system of vote-and-sms from the audience. she was judged by legends such as lata mangeshkar, bhupen hazarika and manna dey, and the winners were chosen based on their performances alone. while a reality show was always a full-scale production, on-stage theatrics and appearances were kept to a minimum.?there were no back stories shared with the viewers, it was all about the quality of singing,? says sunidhi. ?their singing will tell their stories, if they are good.?back in the     s, popular dance show boogie woogie and the singing competition sa re ga ma pa, both of which started as contests for adults, were introduced in an all-new avatar targeting children. ?the idea then was to showcase young and obscure talent,? notes a      article in mint, ?nothing was promised or bequeathed, except the vague idea that once seen, someone, somewhere would maybe sign them on for a minor playback singing role in a movie.?for shekhar, his reality show stint meant recognition of his talent. ?in an era where being a musician wasn?t considered to be a credible career choice, my talent was given the importance that made my family and others sit up and notice,? he says.the focus has shifted. children on reality shows are not just ?discovered? or polished, but are groomed to become versatile artistes who can perform onstage and enthral millions. meghna prem, a tv programming and content strategist with an experience of over    years in the entertainment industry, says, ?teenage kids are expected to diet to look a certain way, dress a certain way. because unlike yesteryears, today when you are selecting a reality star, s/he can?t just be a great singer and not be good looking.?when ambition meets pressurearuna broota, a delhi-based psychologist has counselled several professional child actors and child atheletes. according to her, the pressures faced by children on reality shows are no different, perhaps worse. not only are the participants too young to worry about discovering their ambitions, but are often under pressure from fame-thirsty parents trying to live their dreams vicariously.?the child?s ?ambitions? are artificially hyped, because it?s mostly an adult who takes the decision for them,? says broota. ?s/he might have that s-factor, or the special ability factor, be it in singing, dancing or acting. but when one starts expecting a lot from one?s s-factor in terms of competition, it distorts the personality development of the child.? at an age when all they should be worried about is playing, studying and having fun, children are entangled in a web of competition and stress.this is not the first time that a discussion on the need to regulate child participation in reality shows has come up. in     , the national commission for protection of child rights (ncpcr) drew up new guidelines to prevent exploitation of children participating in tv shows and advertisements.over five years have elapsed since the report was released, yet the realities on the ground paint a different, disturbing picture. under the ncpcr guidelines, no child should be made to deliver lines or enact scenes that are inappropriate for his or her age. yet, children dancing on raunchy numbers or belting out romantic songs is mined for applause and laughs. a web of competition and stressreality television immediately catapults children to popularity. suddenly every parent wants his/her child to become like them. neighbours are extra doting. they are now their teachers? favourite student, no longer tied to the compulsions of attendance in school. cameras click wherever they go. they get to rub shoulders with their idols from the industry. they are famous, and everyone knows them. but what happens once the show ends?salman khan and sohail khan during the promotion of film tubelight on the sets of zee tv`s musical reality sa re ga ma pa li`l champs.         (ians)        ?in reality shows, kids are complimented so much that they get used to it,? says chauhan. ?when a participant is told s/he sang better than the original, the kid thinks s/he has arrived. and when they face any criticism or are eliminated, their ego and confidence come crashing down. self-doubt sets in. and i think it?s too early for them to feel any of these emotions.?children find it difficult to cope with the lull once their    minutes of fame are over. ?either they get into depression, or develop different kinds of behaviour pathologies,? says broota. ?just to grab attention and have that sense of power, some take to lying and self-harm. alienation in schools from their peers is yet another outcome of this limelight.?meghna recounts instances when participants of reality shows talked to her about how they feel their equations with friends changed. ?she was my best friend, but now she isn?t talking to me anymore?, she remembers one of the participants confiding. the race for trp means high drama on stage. cameras zoom into tight close ups of parents crying when their kids are eliminated. what message does that send out to the child? ?you have let us down,? says broota. a child, who would otherwise have been indifferent and taken the judges? decision with a smile, is filled with guilt because s/he can see the disappointment on his parents? face.show runners ensure that trps are not valued over children?s mental and emotional well-being ? running a reality show for kids is after all, no child?s play. but shekhar believes that parents? shoulder the responsibility of knowing what they are putting their child through. ?they should judge the environment where they are sending their kids and ensure that their child is able to withstand the long working hours that these shoots sometimes entail,? he says.","singer sunidhi chauhan, while talking about reality shows that feature kids, said she would never want her children to go through these shows. she added, ""they don't need to mature ahead of their age."" sunidhi, who won a singing reality show when she was   , believes that children are ""exposed to so much, so soon"" in reality shows these days."

a hypnotic mix of nervousness, fear, paranoia, and careful optimism.this is a pilgrimage, after all. to some, nolan is a god, and his temple?s walls, dark and foreboding, seem to push in as the lights go down. your senses, usually dulled by a mundane existence, are heightened. you?ve never experienced anything like it.the crowd?s hushed tones hit you in waves, and even the most distant whisper is deafening ? but it reassures as much as it startles. there are others like you. and like you, they?ve waited years for this moment. you are not alone. and the electricity you?ve created ? together ? in the cavernous place of worship, could power a small town.i have experienced this sensation on four occasions, before four christopher nolan films, and each of those experiences were, and remain to this day, some of the most special i?ve had inside a movie theatre.and yesterday, it happened again.dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature ? an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war. it is an existential masterpiece set across three parallel plots destined to collide, which in turn are set on three planes of existence ? earth, air, and water. to us, these elements symbolise life, but in dunkirk, they might as well be harbingers of death, having suspended our characters in their purgatory as they await judgment.on the land, in the seaside french town of dunkirk,    ,    soldiers have been pushed by ?the enemy? ? curiously, not once are the nazis mentioned ? towards the sea. they wait, bombarded from behind, and up above, for deliverance. before them lies a seemingly endless expanse of blue ? and home, england, is practically within sight, across the choppy waters of the channel. they go from boat to boat ? some even conning their way onto the rickety barges ? desperate to get off the cursed beach, as torpedoes attack them from below, and missiles rain like hellfire from the sky.they?re in need of a miracle.but help is on its way. tom hardy protects them from above, acting, like he did in the dark knight rises, through a mask, and only with his eyes. and his eyes are all he needs to convey the (sometimes scarily suicidal) determination to save his countrymen, as he picks off one luftwaffe fighter after another ? even as his wingmen perish, and his fuel gauge begs him to stop.below him, on the water, a civilian mark rylance has commandeered a boat, one of the many deployed by the navy in an effort to aid the evacuation process. with his teenage son, and his son?s eager friend in tow ? but without a firm plan ? he sails into war.and with the precision of a watchmaker ? time is an oft-repeated motif in the film ? nolan, a master working at the peak of his powers, puts the pieces of this jigsaw together with some of his most effortless editing since inception. and like inception, as layer after layer of dunkirk?s nesting doll structure is uncovered, and when the three stories finally converge after almost two hours of merciless tension, the emotional release is pure ecstasy.often, in order to build this tension, the experimental work of genius that it is, dunkirk spends long stretches in silence. dp hoyte van hoytema?s imax camera, taking a break from soaring across the skies, wrestling for space among thousands of men, and gazing placidly at the sheer beauty of it all, brings the actors? faces inches from its own. and these fine performers ? mostly young stars (harry styles included) ? convey wordlessly the torment raging in their characters? minds.but because of these periods of silence, and because of nolan?s refusal to rely on words (or, for that matter, a traditional structure) to tell his story, hans zimmer?s terrific score becomes crucial, and slowly, emerges as a character in its own right. like the film, it is unrelentingly intense, stretched to breaking point as it conjures tension seemingly from nothing.and such is nolan?s power at commanding the attention of his audience, that you find yourself overlooking basic flaws. there isn?t a single character in this film that is properly fleshed out, and it fails miserably at the bechdel test. but never have these glaring missteps mattered less.do you remember what bruce wayne said at the end of the dark knight rises? moments before flying into certain death, he looked at commissioner gordon, and growled, ?a hero can be anyone.?and this is the sentiment that nolan has carried into dunkirk. these characters aren?t meant to have elaborate backstories or complicated motivations. they?re meant to represent an ideal. they?re meant to embody our bravery and our empathy and our kindness.a hero can be anyone, from a middle-aged sailor who just wants to teach his son to do the right thing, to a decorated commander who refuses to leave until every last man who serves under him ? or even if he doesn?t ? has been saved.dunkirk is one of the greatest war movies ever made ? it?s certainly the tightest, most unwaveringly propulsive film of christopher nolan?s career. but it?s also as meditative as the thin red line, as brutal as saving private ryan, and sometimes, even as surreal as apocalypse now.it deserves to be seen big and loud.watch the dunkirk trailer herefollow @htshowbiz for morethe author tweets @rohannaahar","director christopher nolan's film dunkirk which released on friday, ""is one of the greatest war movies ever made,"" wrote hindustan times. the guardian wrote, ""it's a visceral piece of film-making,"" while times of india called it ""the first real contender for best picture"" at oscars. the film has been rated  /  (hindustan times, the guardian) and  . /  (times of india)."

"phillauri is a supernatural comedy where a man gets stuck with a friendly spirit after he is made to marry a tree. here is our phillauri movie review.phillauri cast: anushka sharma, diljit dosanjh, suraj sharma, mehreen pirzadaphillauri direction: anshai lalphillauri rating:  ( . / ) when the friendly spirit shashi is asked why she is stuck with the soon-to-be-married kanan, she says, ""pata nahi, main to yahi atki hui hoon."" anshai lal's    -minute long phillauri could speak for itself here.once the one-line idea of guy-getting-married-to-spirit has been established, the film hovers around, like shashi, from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting nor of any service to whatever goodness the film has.so, kaneda-return punjabi boy kanan,   , returns to india to get married. cue: boisterous punjabi family scenes during wedding season. kanan is played superbly by life of pi actor suraj sharma. kanan beat-boxes when he is asked to sing by his family. later, he escapes them and goes to the roof to roll a j. when his fiance anu (a decent mehreen pirzada) asks if he is ready for the marriage, he goes ""yo, chill."" phillauri is pretty entertaining and appears promising in these initial scenes till the point kanan is married to a tree because of being a manglik and shashi, the spirit enters his life.now once this set up has been established, you need solid plot developments to fill the rest of the ninety minutes. this, phillauri lacks. a premise like this has the potential to deliver a good supernatural comedy a la beetlejuice or casper. as such, the usual direction a story like this can take is one where the human(s) and the ghost(s) slowly resolve their innermost crises by being in constant proximity to each other and this is achieved by a series of good, well-written scenes.now, kanan's crisis is that  . he is unsure of getting married and  . there is a ghost living with him. shashi's crisis is that she is stuck with kanan; her story arc is resolved in the most predictable way at the end and it is strange that this was not made the film's focus from the very beginning. as long as kanan and shashi are together on screen, for the most part, phillauri is interesting. in friendly-ghost films like these, it is the way the human and the ghost play off each other and the weird situations they create is what makes these films worth watching.but kanan-shashi's parts are punctuated by an elaborate backstory that is just dull and diljit dosanjh is a decent performer, sure, but he is not a big enough khan to make mediocre writing worthwhile. the period-backstory involving shashi and her lover, played by diljit, seriously drags the film. sometimes, the cloying sentimentality of these portions is nauseating and these scenes jut out like a sore thumb in the middle of the fun kanan-shashi moments.phillauri's concept is good and novel. but the delivery is what north indians call klpd. the climactic payoff at the end comes way too easily. it's just lazy writing after a point. if only shashi emerged in the writer's room before filming began and smacked some imagination into anvita dutt's head.(the writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)","anushka sharma's phillauri ""hovers...from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting,"" wrote india today.

"the fifa president, gianni infantino, has robustly defended the decision to expand the world cup from    competing national teams to   , which will begin with the      tournament, in the face of immediate criticism from top european clubs. at a meeting in zurich, fifa?s rule-making council unanimously passed the new format, which will create a first round of    groups, from which two of three teams will qualify and proceed to a knockout competition beginning with    countries.fifa has projected that the increase to    countries will generate around $ bn more income, and $   m profit, from greater television rights and sponsorship. infantino said the money will be reinvested in football; he has promised all fifa?s     member countries? associations $ m a year to aid development.speaking after the meeting, infantino argued that the expanded tournament will increase interest in football worldwide by involving more countries, while not burdening players with more matches.responding robustly to criticism from the german football association (dfb) and european club association (eca), which derided fifa?s decision as having been taken for ?political reasons rather than sporting ones,? infantino said: ?we are in the   st century, and we should shape the world cup for the   st century. football is more than europe and south america; football is global.?fifa?s football associations, particularly in africa and asia, have historically been in favour of the tournament?s expansion, which infantino said will give them all more places in the finals. precise numbers are yet to be decided, as are some of the format?s details, including whether drawn first-round group matches could all be decided on penalties. the host for the      tournament is due to be considered in     , with a bid featuring the us, either on its own or in conjunction with one or both of canada and mexico, the overwhelming favourite.arguing that qualification for the world cup provides a key boost to football development in smaller countries, infantino pointed to the advances of iceland, wales and hungary in last year?s european championship as examples of ?beautiful stories?. european football?s governing body, uefa, decided in      to expand its tournament from    countries to   , and europe?s representatives on fifa?s council supported the world cup increase, despite the opposition from leading clubs.in a statement the eca, which has     member clubs in    european countries, said that the    team format is ?a perfect formula? and suggested that infantino had in mind electoral support from fifa?s member associations, which each vote for for the president. questioning the ?urgency? with which so historic a decision was taken, less than a year since infantino was elected, the eca said ?stakeholders? who will be ?impacted? had not been properly involved.?we understand that this decision has been taken based on political reasons rather than sporting ones and under considerable political pressure, something eca believes is regrettable,? the statement said.infantino declined to respond to reports immediately after fifa?s announcement that the spanish football league, la liga, which claimed it was not consulted at all, is considering a lawsuit. last week the dfb president, reinhard grindel, expressed ?immense reservations? about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing    more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.referring to his election last february on a proposal to expand the world cup to    teams, infantino said the prime objection from european clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournament?s length. he said fifa administrators had since examined four different formats and found that the   -team expansion could address those concerns.the immediate move to a   -team knockout competition after the two matches played by each country in the first round of    groups, means the finalists will have played seven games, the same as in the current format. the tournament can still be played over    days, as it is now. infantino pointed out that uefa?s expansion lengthened the european championship by a week, and incorporated one more match for the finalists.arguing that the quality of football is improving around the world, and pointing to the elimination of both england and italy by costa rica in the last world cup in     , infantino said: ?increasing the size of teams which can participate will increase the investment in football development, to make sure that the teams can qualify.?the fa?s chief executive, martin glenn, had said his preference was ?to keep the tournament smaller,? but he acknowledged that ?smaller countries understandably want to be part of the tournament.? the english representative on the fifa council, david gill, did not attend the meeting because of a previously arranged visit to australia, but given the strength of support for the expansion, he had been expected to vote in favour.in a statement after the decision, the fa said: ?we will work with uefa, fifa and the other european associations to understand how the   -team fifa world cup will work. the priority has to be consideration of the potential impact on fans, players, teams and leagues, and also recognition of the importance of sporting integrity and commercial viability.?","fifa on tuesday announced that penalty shootouts will be used to decide drawn matches between teams in the group stages of the fifa world cup, which shall feature    teams from the      edition onwards. the move is aimed at minimising the risk of teams colluding in their final group games to eliminate others from the tournament."

""}}with all the hue and cry around it, you would expect a film that is all about sex. except, this isn?t.lipstick under my burkha is a simple story about four women and their dreams - of financial independence, of becoming a singer, of moving to a big city and of simply, enjoying life. the fact that these desires remain hidden from the society makes their desires seem like adventurous trips. lipsticks, in the film, are these desires while the patriarchal society is the burkha. the film does not loudly cheer feminism or as cbfc chief pahlaj nihalani calls it, ?lady-oriented?. alankrita chooses a subtle narrative style to tell us the stories of four different women who are fighting a male chauvinist society and mindset. and therein lies the beauty of lipstick under my burkha which is set in a small town. alankrita shows a very relatable and authentic bhopal in her movie and her characters are all realistic. they have their own set of small, yet, irritating problems dealing with the male-dominated society.shireen (konkona) is a housewife who works a salesgirl but needs to hide her job from her husband (sushant). bua jee aka usha (ratna) is a   -year-old woman rendered devoid of desires because of her age but enjoys reading soft porn hidden in her religious books. leela (aahana) is a free-spirited woman who feels suffocated in the small town of bhopal and uses her sexuality to manipulate the men in her life. rihanna (plabita) is a young college girl who idolises miley cyrus and wants to follow her fashion style. she has to hide her desires of a becoming a singer under a burkha, thanks to her orthodox parents. every character in the film deals with different kinds of prejudices and restrictions but eventually, they prove to be the same - curbing the freedom of women. the small town setting enables the four characters to be part of each others? lives and eventually come together.lipstick under my burkha is no didactic piece on how women should be treated, neither is it an all-out-war against patriarchy. the film is a subdued conversation starter - let us talk about women?s desires as well as their rights, let women open up about their dreams.lipstick under my burkha brings in a lot of issues - from dictates on women?s clothing to forced sex in a marriage, it addresses all of them boldly. this is a bold film not because it talks of women?s sexuality but because it draws attention to their desires and problems and does so in the most glaring colours. alankrita has an army of wonderful actors to support her engaging movie. be it sushant, konkona, plabita, ratna, vikrant or aahana, all of them belong to their characters and are impressive. this is one of those rare films in which it is difficult to pick a favourite but konkona?s performance rises among them as she is the one who is not dependent on others to fulfil her desires. not to complain about others? dreams as they simply happen to be such that cannot be completed without others? help. it is laughable that the cbfc had problems with such a light film that merely talks about women nurturing their own desires that cross the boundaries of a male-dominated society. while the final scene of the film might work for some,i would have loved it had it been more decisive. a closure to the narratives would have provided for a more positive and optimistic cinema, what lipstick under my burkha aims to be. this is a film you must not miss as it is not everyday that bollywood films talk of women and their desires.follow @htshowbiz for more","'lipstick under my burkha', which released on friday, is ""worth the hype...a must watch"", wrote the quint. hindustan times wrote the film is not ""an all-out-war against patriarchy"" but ""a subdued conversation starter"". mid-day wrote, ""it's a thoroughly entertaining film on a society at the cusp of major change"". it was rated  . /  (the quint),  /  (mid-day) and  . /  (ht)."
"it is afternoon. mandeep singh randhawa has just arrived at his office, flanked by two junior officers. around a dozen men and women wait patiently in a room next to his cabin. a few certificates of merit adorn the walls.?please give me a few minutes,? randhwa, deputy commissioner of police (central delhi),  tells the visitors and moves straight to his seat and reaches out for the desktop. as he moves the mouse, the monitor, which is on the sleep mode, comes alive with a colourful geospatial map of the area under his control. he zooms in on a micro-scale section of the area, which has crime hots pots marked in red. randhawa applies a few filters on the new crime-mapping software, and examines the calls made to the police control room about street crimes such as snatching, robbery and vehicle thefts in his territorial district. pausing for a few moments, he reaches for his wireless handset and connects all acps and shos of his district one by one.?deploy two bike patrolling teams on either side of bahadur shah zafar marg in the press area. there were two snatching and robbery calls between   pm and   pm last night from the stretch. i don?t want a rerun of the crimes tonight,? he sternly tells the sho of the ip estate police station over the wireless set before scrolling through the application again.the dcp has identified the crime hot spot and possibility of any repeat of the crime in the area through a new software called cmaps (crime mapping analytics and predictive system). the web-based software accesses real-time data from delhi police?s dial     helpline and, using isro?s satellite imageries, spatially locates the calls and visualises them as cluster maps to identify crime hot spots.the software?s statistical models and algorithms help the police understand where the next crime is likely to occur. this concept called ?predictive policing? marks a paradigm shift in policing in the national capital spread across  ,    square kilometers and divided into    police districts, each headed by a dcp. police get over   ,    calls on dial     every day on an average. ?we are not predicting the future, what we are predicting is where and when a crime is likely to happen based on scientific and objective analysis of data. and this will determine where our next observations are going to be,? says sanjay beniwal, special commissioner of police (operations) sitting in his ninth-floor office at the police headquarters, which gives a panoramic view of the city. ?in a mega city, we believe a lot of crimes are predictable and can be curbed,? he says.cmaps, which updates the data every three minutes, replaces delhi police?s mechanical crime mapping ?which involves manually gathering data at an interval of    days. the new software, beniwal explains, allows the information generated though dial    to be plotted on the geospatial map of delhi, enabling the police to pinpoint exact locations and spatial distribution of the crime. ?we can study the pattern of calls coming from a particular location. suppose if there are too many robbery calls coming from a location which has a bar nearby, we can match those calls with past crimes in the area and understand if that bar is in any way responsible for these robberies, and whether another crime is likely to occur there,? he says. many cities such as los angeles and kent in the us, and berlin in germany are using predictive policing techniques to prevent crime. in fact, the idea of crime forecasting took shape in      when two chicago criminologists, clifford r shaw and henry d mckay, conducted a research, exploring the persistence of juvenile crime in some neighbourhoods of the city. they came up with the social disorganisation theory, which states that location matters when it comes to predicting illegal activity.dcp ms randhawa coordinates police deployment in the capital on the basis of crime mapping analytics and predictive system from his office in new delhi.          (arun sharma/ht photo)        that is when scientists began experimenting with data technologies, including statistical and geospatial analysis, to determine prevalence of crime. the researchers have been using everything from basic regression analysis to cutting-edge mathematical models to predict when and where the next crime is likely to occur. but until recently, the limits of computing power and storage prevented them from using large data sets. what softwares such as cmaps have done is allow larger data collection, and process it in a much more sophisticated mathematical way ? a significant improvement over just manual hotspot mapping, which delhi police have been doing so far.but statistical model-based predictive policing has raised concerns in the west that it might create prejudices against particular communities or areas and how much power should be accorded to computer algorithms.?any statistical model can be flawed, but we hope it will be too dynamic to hold any area guilty of a crime for long,? says beniwal. ?the web-based software will soon be available on mobile and even a beat constable will have maps showing locations where crime is likely to occur,? says an officer. ?it is all about using science to curb crime,? says beniwal.what is predictive policingpredictive policing is the application of data analytical techniques to identify likely targets for police intervention and prevent crimes by making statistical predictions. a crime forecasting software involves statistical models and algorithmshow it works   predective policing starts with collecting large amounts of data on past crime and co-relating them with present crimes. cmaps, delhi police?s crime mapping and predictive software is integrated with delhi police?s new software and allows the information getting generated though dial    to be plotted on geo- spatial map of delhi   analyze data: software looks for patterns and correlations in past crime data  predictive maps: algorithm predicts where and when a crime is likely to happen in future   increased surveillance: based on the possibility of the crime, police add or redeploys resources during certain period to prevent crime","the delhi police is using a new software, which accesses real-time data from its helpline and helps identify crime hotspots. police can then deploy enough policemen at these places. ""in a mega city, we believe a lot of crimes are predictable and can be curbed,"" said an official. the software will replace manual data gathering, which happens every    days."

"by juhi chakraborty new delhi, jul    (pti) aadar jains entry in bollywood comes at a time when the nepotism debate has gained momentum but the newcomer says he would like people to not judge him before seeing his work. aadar, the grandson of raj kapoor, will make his debut with ""qaidi band"" and his launch event was hosted by his cousin ranbir kapoor. in an interview with pti, the actor says he is aware of the debate around nepotism and the negative comments his launch attracted. ""as a newcomer, who has always dreamt of becoming an actor, it was a huge deal for me to be introduced like that. i read the comments after the launch about nepotism. ""when you work so hard, give it all, an entire year of blood, sweat and hard work and then you read about these comments, you feel bad. i am human after all,"" aadar says. but the   -year-old actor does not want to get into the debate of whether he is talented or not. ""i dont want to say anything. yes, i feel bad when people says things without seeing my work. i want my work to speak for itself. thats the only thing i am here for."" however, aadar does have an opinion about nepotism in the film industry. the youngster says someone belonging to a film family does get an easy opportunity to meet a director or a casting director but it does not guarantee a movie as an actor can only go forward on the basis of merit. ""the industry believes in talent. it doesnt matter what background you are from, you might be an outsider or from a film family, what matters is your talent. i had to audition for the film. ""i might come from a film family but that didnt guarantee me anything. at the end of the day i dont think a writer, director or producer will invest in a person who does not have the talent."" on the contrary, aadar feels actors, who hail from film families, have to deal with the burden of expectations. yash raj films ""qaidi band"" has been directed by habib faisal and will also serve as the launchpad for another newcomer, anya singh. the film is about seven under-trials, who form a musical band in the prison. the movie is a far-cry from the usual glamorous debut which newcomers often opt for but aadar says he didnt think of it like that when he signed the project. ""i had not thought about it as an unconventional film and thats why i did it. this is a kind of film that i would like to watch. it is refreshing, new and a story not told before."" on his role as a prison inmate, aadar says he had no real understanding of how to go about the role as his only references have been movies and tv shows like ""shawshank redemption"" and ""prison break"". ""i didnt know what actually happens inside a prison. that was very interesting for me especially the under-trial situation. that fascinated me. those are the reasons why i wanted to do the film."" ""qaidi band"" releases on august   . aadars elder brother, armaan jain, made his debut in      with ""lekar hum deewana dil"", which was a box office dud. the actor says armaan has not taken a beating and will soon announce his second bollywood venture. ","speaking about nepotism remarks which followed the announcement of his launch by yash raj films, actor raj kapoor's grandson aadar jain said that he felt bad and added, ""i'm human after all."" he added, ""yes, i feel bad when people says things without seeing my work."" aadar will be seen making his acting debut with yrf film 'qaidi band'."

"a     bn class-action lawsuit against mastercard for allegedly overcharging more than    million people in britain over a   -year period was blocked by a british court on friday. the competition appeal tribunal (cat), a newly empowered court that oversees britain?s fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to continue to trial. had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in british legal history and would have tested the limits of the new consumer rights act, which introduced us-style ?opt-out? collective class actions for breaches of uk or european union competition law in     . mastercard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was ?completely unsuitable? to be brought under the collective action regime.a law firm, quinn emanuel urquhart & sullivan, launched the case on behalf of adults in britain after mastercard lost a drawn-out appeal against a      european commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. the case centred on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as mastercard on merchants? banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. it alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all uk consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just mastercard holders. london-based walter merricks, a lawyer who once led the financial ombudsman service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers. ?the new collective action regime was introduced by the consumer rights act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,? he said. ?i am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.? he added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that mastercard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. the planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the ?perfect exam question? for britain?s cat, nominated in      to oversees the country?s maiden ?opt-out? class action lawsuits in antitrust cases. under the regime, uk-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out. critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. but others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for uk-based consumers and businesses that fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together.the high court ruled in january that mastercard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers. ","a      billion (? .   lakh crore) class-action lawsuit against mastercard, for allegedly overcharging over  .  crore people in britain over a   -year period, was blocked by a court. the tribunal found no individual could receive compensation equal to the loss actually suffered. had it been allowed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in british legal history."

the retired ias and ips officers said, adding, ""these actions undermine the rule of law and the indian constitution since only the state - through its various organs and institutions - has the power to enforce the law.""following is the full text:open letter by retired officials on the growing religious intolerancesaturday    june     the following is an open letter of sixtyfive retired officials released on june   ,     .we are a group of retired officers of all india and central services of different batches, who have worked with the central and state governments in the course of our careers. we should make it clear that as a group, we have no affiliation with any political party but believe in the credo of impartiality, neutrality and commitment to the indian constitution. a sense of deep disquiet at what has been happening in india has prompted us to write this open letter to chronicle our reservations and misgivings about recent developments in the body politic. what has gone wrong?it appears as if there is a growing climate of religious intolerance that is aimed primarily at muslims. in uttar pradesh, in the run-up to the elections, an odious and frankly communal comparison was made between the relative number of burial grounds and cremation grounds. the question was also asked as to whether electricity was being supplied equally to different communities during their religious festivals. all this without any basis in fact or evidence. the banning of slaughter-houses targets the minorities and affects their livelihoods as well. such intolerance breeds violence in a communally charged atmosphere-even to the extent of a local leader in up provoking an attack upon the residence of a superintendent of police, whose family was terrorised.vigilantism has become widespread. an akhlaq is killed on the basis of a suspicion that the meat he has is beef and a pehlu khan is lynched while transporting to his place two cows he had bought and for which he had the necessary papers. nomadic shepherds are attacked in jammu and kashmir on some suspicion as they practice their age-old occu-pation of moving from one place to another along with their cattle and belongings. punitive action against the perpetrators of violence does not take place promptly but cruelly, the victims have firs registered against them. the behaviour of vigilantes-who act as if they are prosecutor, judge and executioner rolled into one-flies in the face of law and juris-prudence. these actions undermine the rule of law and the indian constitution since only the state-through its various organs and insti-tutions-has the power to enforce the law.vigilantism has become popular as 'anti-romeo' squads threaten young couples who go out together, hold hands and are perhaps in love with each other. a thinly-veiled effort to prevent a hindu-muslim relationship or marriage, there is no justification in law to harass these couples, particularly when there is no complaint from the woman of being ill-treated.student groups and faculty members on campuses like hyderabad and jnu, who raise troubling questions about equality, social justice and freedom, are subject to attack by the administration, with a supportive government to back them. in jodhpur, a planned lecture by a renowned academic was cancelled under pressure and the faculty that organised the event subjected to disciplinary action. what happened in jodhpur has happened at other institutions as well. argumentation and discussion about different perspectives-the life-blood not only of institutions of learning but of democracy itself-are being throttled. disagree-ment and dissent are considered seditious and anti-national. such attitudes have a chilling impact on free speech and thought.several reputed ngos and civil society organisations are being charged with violating the provisions of the foreign contribution (regulation) act and the income tax act. while we agree that genuine violators should be identified and penalised, we note with dismay that several of the targeted groups are those who have taken stands against government policies, expressed dissent or supported communities in cases against the state.we are also seeing an ugly trend of trolling, threats and online intimidation of activists, journalists, writers and intellectuals who disagree with the dominant ideology. how does this square with free speech?there is a growing hyper-nationalism that reduces any critique to a binary: if you are not with the government, you are anti-national. those in authority should not be questioned- that is the clear message.in the face of a rising authoritarianism and majoritarianism, which do not allow for reasoned debate, discussion and dissent, we appeal to all public authorities, public institutions and constitutional bodies to take heed of these disturbing trends and take corrective action. we have to reclaim and defend the spirit of the constitution of india, as envisaged by the founding fathers.(inputs from seemi pasha in new delhi) also read| story of lynching: kashmir to haryana, how hate crime thrives in absence of lawsrinagar: dsp ayyub pandith beaten to death by mob

"encounter sites: official srinagar, apr    (pti) nearly     whatsapp groups were being used to mobilise stone-pelters in kashmir to disrupt security forces operations at encounter sites, of which    per cent have been shut down, a police official said today. each of these     whatsapp groups had around     members, the official said while explaining how determined attempts were being made to disrupt the operations of the security forces by mobilising stone-pelting mobs at the encounter sites. ""we identified the groups and the group administrators, who were called in by police for counselling. we have had a good response to this initiative,"" he said on the condition of anonymity. in the last three weeks, more than    per cent of these whatsapp groups have been shut down, the official said. he said the governments policy of suspending internet services appeared to be showing positive results in curbing stone-pelting during encounters and cited the case of yesterdays encounter in budgam district. just a few youth gathered to hurl stones after two militants were gunned down in the encounter yesterday. this was in sharp contrast to an encounter in durbugh village in the same area on march   , when a large number of stone-pelters had assembled and three of them were killed in firing by security forces. ""with no internet services, the mobilisation of mobs has almost become impossible. earlier, we would see youth from as far as    kilometres from the encounter sites joining the protesters to pelt stones at security forces to disrupt the anti-militancy operations. ""that did not happen yesterday during or after the encounter in the absence of internet on mobiles,"" the official said. he said some of the youth listed personal issues like alleged harassment by security forces as reasons for taking to stone-pelting. ""most of them get carried away momentarily,"" he said, adding authorities are also looking at further sensitising the personnel on the need to adopt a humane approach while dealing with the youth. ""with the internet facility withdrawn, the activity on these social networking groups and other sites like facebook has come down drastically,"" he added. stone-pelting on security forces near the encounter sites has been causing major operational problems for the law enforcing agencies over the past one year. more than half a dozen youth have been killed in such incidents in the first quarter of this year. however, the common people especially those from the business community say they are facing hardships, because of the inability to stay connected online. ""today, the business depends on internet for communication. i am into stock markets and i have had no business since the mobile internet services were withdrawn on monday,"" mudasir bhat said. bhat said most of the people had done away with landlines and broadband internet services as mobile internet facility gave them more freedom and were also cheaper. ishfaq ahmad, a contractor by profession, said life, without internet, had come to a standstill. ","nearly     whatsapp groups were being used to mobilise stone-pelters in kashmir to disrupt security operations at encounter sites, according to reports. each of these groups had around     members and more than   % of the groups have been shut down, they added. the government's policy of suspending internet services has reportedly produced positive results."
"gains: vhp new delhi, feb    (pti) the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) today said nda constituent shiv sena was never a hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. speaking to reporters here, vhp joint general secretary surendra jain said that merely chanting king shivajis name does not make shiv sena a hindutvavadi (one championing the hindutva cause) party. ""i dont think shiv sena was ever a hindutvavadi organisation. it is the media which gave this tag to shiv sena after babri mosque was demolished,"" jain said.

""when they talk about hindutva...are hindus from tamil nadu not hindus? whether hindus from bihar and uttar pradesh are not hindus? even today, they are beaten there (in mumbai).

"washington, jan    (pti) the human appendix, which is thought to be of little use to the body, may actually serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria, a new study has found. the appendix, a narrow pouch that projects off the cecum in the digestive system, has a notorious reputation for its tendency to become inflamed (appendicitis), often resulting in surgical removal. although it is widely viewed as a vestigial organ with little known function, the new study suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. in particular, it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria. several other mammal species also have an appendix and studying how it evolved and functions in these species may shed light on this mysterious organ in humans. researchers from the midwestern university arizona college of osteopathic medicine in the us gathered data on the presence or absence of the appendix and other gastrointestinal and environmental traits for     mammal species. they mapped the data onto a phylogeny (genetic tree) to track how the appendix has evolved through mammalian evolution, and to try to determine why some species have an appendix while others do not. they discovered that the appendix has evolved independently in several mammal lineages, over    separate times, and almost never disappears from a lineage once it has appeared. this suggests that the appendix likely serves an adaptive purpose. looking at ecological factors, such as diet, climate, how social a species is, and where it lives, they were able to reject several previously proposed hypotheses that have attempted to link the appendix to dietary or environmental factors. instead, they found that species with an appendix have higher average concentrations of lymphoid (immune) tissue in the cecum. this finding suggests that the appendix may play an important role as a secondary immune organ.

"in the last few months, india?s pervasive culture of privilege has got a sound beating: in march, ravindra gaikwad, an mp, hit a   -year-old air india (ai) employee with a slipper and soon found himself on a ?no-fly? list. then in april, the cabinet banned red beacons on cars. and prime minister narendra modi announced that there are no vips, every indian is a very important person.on wednesday, air india (ai) scrapped one more privilege, this time an in-house one. air india chairman and managing director ashwani lohani asked the staff to carry their hand baggage on their own and not use porters as has been the practice so far. air india has a subsidiary called ai-sats, a ground handling agency, which provides end-to-end services such as passenger and baggage handling. apart from this, some people are reserved to assist vips and airline staff. they are called porters and carry the luggage of the ?vip? passenger from the entry gate to the boarding point. but now only vips will continue to use the services of porters, the airline staff will be discouraged to use it. ?even cmd will not use the porter service,? the airline said.while the move appreciable, the change is cosmetic. the move would have got a higher rating if this privilege was taken away from vips too. while such changes are fine and make for good optics, there are so many things that the ai needs to fix and, hopefully, those will also get adequate attention. take for example, the airline?s rating and public perception. in january, flight data firm flightstats marked ai as the third worst-performing airline in the world. the portland-headquartered firm?s survey highlighted issues over cabins, service quality, and flight delays. though air india disagreed with the report, such reports do impact public perception and eventually bookings. it is important to manage perceptions and ai has to invest time, effort and money into it apart from doing away with perks and privileges extended to staff.  then its finances. as a columnist pointed out last week, the organisation has consistently incurred losses and is severely debt-ridden despite equity infusion of around rs   ,    crore since     . more damaging was the comptroller and auditor general?s performance audit report of the airline, which was tabled in parliament in march. the report said inefficiencies in the company may mean that a lot more of public money will be needed to keep the maharaja afloat.  ","air india chairman ashwani lohani on wednesday sent a whatsapp message to air india staff, including senior officers, asking them to carry their own hand baggage. lohani, who called the move ""in line with the pm's drive towards simplicity in public life,"" will also carry his own baggage. henceforth, only mps and unwell staff can request help with luggage."

"scientists have developed a new genetic test for alzheimer?s risk that can be used to predict the age at which a person will develop the disease.a high score on the test, which is based on    genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found. those ranked in the top   % in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop alzheimer?s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest   %.rahul desikan, of the university of california ? who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual?s risk of developing alzheimer?s that year.?that is, if you don?t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for ad onset, based on your age and genetic information,? he said.the so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than   ,    individuals, including patients with alzheimer?s disease and healthy elderly people.it is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in alzheimer?s. around a quarter of patients have a strong family history of the disease, and scientists have shown this is partly explained by a gene called apoe, which comes in three versions, and is known to have a powerful influence on the risk of getting the most common late-onset type of alzheimer?s. one version of apoe appears to reduce risk by up to   %, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by    times.the latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from apoe, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on alzheimer?s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial.the researchers first identified nearly  ,    single letter differences in the genetic code (known as snps) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on    of the markers. the test was then used to accurately predict an individual?s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort.in people with the high-risk version of apoe, those ranked in the top   % of risk on the new test got alzheimer?s at an average age of    years, compared with    years for those ranked in the lowest   %.james pickett, head of research at alzheimer?s society, said: ?preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of alzheimer?s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition. this study?s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-us populations.? pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic.rosa sancho, head of research at alzheimer?s research uk, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk. ?genetics is only part of the story and we know that lifestyle factors also influence our risk of developing alzheimer?s,? she said. ?the best current evidence points to habits we can all adopt to help lower our risk and indicates that what?s good for your heart is also good for the brain.?the findings are published in the journal plos medicine.","scientists have developed a test that can predict the age at which a person could develop alzheimer's. the test calculates the risk of onset of disease based on genetic markers developed from data of over   ,    individuals having alzheimer's and otherwise. researchers said that while genetics can influence the risk of dementia, a healthy lifestyle can also curb the risk."

"as a part of prime minister modi's digital india initiative, the indian railways have partnered with google to provide wi-fi broadband facility to passengers at major railway stations across the country. this google railtel initiative was launched in january      and till date has reached     stations across india. their lofty aim is to reach     stations by     .under this initiative, railtel, a subsidiary of the government of india provides the high speed network via fiber while google sets up the wireless infrastructure and provides tech support. the speeds on offer range from   -  mbps for    minutes after which they are gradually reduced in order to manage bandwidth.the india today tech had the opportunity to experience google's railtel initiative first hand at nizamuddin railway station. we also interviewed gulzar azad  -- head of connectivity, google india -- who spoke about the partnership with railtel, the challenges faced in bringing high-speed wi-fi to     of india's major railway stations, what google and railtel have learnt along the way and the road ahead for this ambitious initiative.q: this initiative started before jio revolutionised the telecom sector with its disruptive plans and brought  g to the masses. have you seen a dip in the daily usage since jio entered the marketplace? has the widespread and cheap availability of  g data since the entry of jio affected google's railtel strategy in any way?this is a great question. very relevant in today's time. what we have seen is that as  g has emerged, we have seen no dip in the wi-fi usage. if you talk about the time when 'free'  g started emerging, we were at about   million (   lakh) monthly active users, today we are at  .  million (   lakh) monthly active users. so the railtel initiative has only grown since then.the railway station is a great point of convergence. at this point of convergence, there is the need for multiple networks and multiple systems to satisfy the user demand. before the advent of 'free'  g, people were not even thinking of consuming  gb data a month, let alone  gb data a day.the mark of telecommunication development of any country is how close the fiber is to the user. in effect, you must see that the wi-fi that we are implementing is an attempt to bring fiber close to the user. and that is working pretty well for us.q: during my interactions with passengers and workers at the nizzamudin railway station, i found out that many of them feel that during peak hours the speed slows down quite a bit. is that something you are looking into?i feel that is also a very interesting, emerging phenomenon. if you see when we started the project, even at peak hours the speed we were giving the users was very satisfactory and now people want more. this is exactly what we were expecting. once people start experiencing high-speed internet, the user behavior changes - the expectation now is higher. there is more demand for less and less latency in the network.the good news for us is that across the last twelve months, we have not seen a dip in monthly active users. the average usage still remains    mb per user per session which shows we have augmented the network and capacity while adding more users.as  g has emerged, we have seen no dip in the wi-fi usage. if you talk about the time when 'free'  g started emerging, we were at about   million monthly active users, today we are at  .  million monthly active usersmr gulzar azad then spoke about how google is taking steps to make the railtel initiative financially viablesince april, we have made the login process ad supported and that is helping railtel from an isp perspective. the revenue is majorly meant for railtel. we have a revenue share mechanism which is expected as we are a contributor to the project itself - google helps build the wireless (infrastructure) and railtel brings in the fibre and the connectivity.q:the railtel initiative was in the news a couple of months ago as it was found that it was being used for watching porn in many railway stations. were any measures put into place after that?the idea of the internet here from an experience point of view is to make it the same internet that you and i have and for that internet to be available to everyone. that is the singular goal of our vision - for a billion people to experience the internet you and i experience in our homes, in our offices.  and when we do that, we are following the regulations set by the country.the isp (railtel) follows the regulations from the government in terms of what's allowed on the internet and what's not. this internet is not different from every other internet across the country.q: if we talk about the speed, i was told that  mbps is the minimum speed even when the    limit high speed cap is crossed. is that a realistic claim?the way the network has been set up there is actually no speed limit before or after. the design of the network is such that in the first    minute time limit, we allow the user to get unfettered access - the idea is to get all users to a point where they could access high quality hd video streams.after the time limit is crossed, we make sure that everybody does still have internet and the net is still low latency. we are adjusting the network dynamically so that people can still access the internet but in the first half an hour they can access hd quality video streams.q: but what is the minimum speed? - i spoke to many people and got a lot of varying replies. some people said it is as bad as    kbps but others said they can stream video for    hours.the quality of your internet is not just measured by the speed. it is also measured by the latency of the network. we have designed the network in a way that even when the network is at low speed, it is still a low latency network. the internet is dynamically configured in such a way that you will still be able perform certain use cases (like opening a search page, running apps like whatsapp and messenger) after the high-speed cap gets over after    minutes.this is a great advancement. if you compare this with wi-fi in london and san francisco, you will find that the wi-fi is better in both coverage and capacitynote: the network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time. this is why the    minute high-speed cap exists. during our time at the nizamuddin railway station we got average speeds of   -  mpbs (download) during the    minute unfettered limit. also, we found out that all access points are already dual-band ( . ghz and  ghz capable) in order to cope with future demand.q: what is the business model that google and railtel are following? how is google benefiting from this project?for google, this is an ecosystem project. our idea with this is to make sure there is more and more broadband adoption. the more the adoption, the more people come online, and the greater the economic impact.when there is economic impact on digitisation, we get directly impacted because we are a stakeholder in the digitisation of the country. also, the more people use internet, the more they use e-commerce, social networks, news websites and eventually google services.q: at the nizamuddin railway station and the new delhi railway station, which i visited a few weeks ago, the advertising is quite minimal. also a lot of people, even in tier   cities like delhi and mumbai are unaware of this initiative. so what is google and railtel's future plans regarding awareness?addressing awareness of wi-fi is certainly an important issue and we need the help of the indian railways and the government to do that more and more. as you can see, the wi-fi is already free, so there is not much space for businesses to market on it. but the indian railways who host this, they should be partnering with us to make more and more awareness happen.there are various channels of awareness. we have tried audio announcements and visuals. we have also tried having agents at the station. i think to raise awareness in a sustainable way we need help from the government.","google's head of connectivity in india recently talked about the google railtel, which has started providing free wifi at     railway stations in india. ""if you compare this with wi-fi in london and san francisco, you will find that the wi-fi is better in both coverage and capacity"", he said. the initiative aims to cover     stations across the country."

"a female engineer at tesla has accused elon musk?s car company of ignoring her complaints of ?pervasive harassment?, paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work, promoting less qualified men over her and retaliating against her for raising concerns.the allegations of aj vandermeyden, who still works at the celebrated electric car manufacturer, paint a picture of a hostile work environment dominated by men where inappropriate sexual behavior is tolerated and women face numerous barriers to advance their careers.vandermeyden,   , shared her story with the guardian at a time when silicon valley is reeling from the explosive allegations of former uber engineer susan fowler. in a viral blogpost, she alleged that management and hr dismissed her complaints about documented sexual harassment and sexism, protected a repeat offender because he was a ?high performer? and suggested that women in the company were not as skilled as men.offering a rare public account of discrimination from a tech worker who remains employed at her company, vandermeyden said her dedication to tesla motivated her to advocate for fair treatment and reforms ? despite the serious risks she knows she faces for going public. ?until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she said in a recent interview, her first comments about a discrimination lawsuit she filed last year. ?i?m an advocate of tesla. i really do believe they are doing great things. that said, i can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.? vandermeyden began at tesla in      and was eventually promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in the general assembly department, which consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over, according to her complaint. it?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to haveit was common for her to be the only woman in meetings with    to    men, she said on a recent morning, seated in the living room of her family?s house in san carlos, the city where tesla was founded, located across the bay from its current factory in fremont.currently, all chief executive positions are held by men at tesla, and out of more than    vice-presidents, only two are women, she added. ?it?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have.?vandermeyden said that when complaints arise at tesla about workplace issues or inequality, the response is often: ??we?re focused on making cars. we don?t have time to deal with all this other stuff.??tesla, founded in     , has gained international recognition for its battery-powered vehicles and ?autonomous? driving technology, promoted by musk, the ambitious entrepreneur who makes headlines for bold pledges about space travel, artificial intelligence, underground tunnels and driverless cars.but vandermeyden?s complaint, filed last fall, alleges that there were inadequacies in the quality testing of cars, and that she raised issues about the flaws she observed, which supervisors and male engineers had missed. although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions above her, her lawyers wrote. she and other female engineers were denied promotions even though they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men, according to the complaint. at the same time, she also experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?, the lawsuit said. vandermeyden recounted to the guardian an incident in      when she said a group of roughly    men standing on a platform above her and a female colleague began taunting as they walked past. ?they all started hooting and hollering and whistling,? she said. ?that can?t happen without somebody noticing ? it?s disturbing.? but her objections about sexual harassment and unequal pay only caused her more trouble, according to her complaint. the lawsuit alleges that after she raised concerns in the fall of     , management told her that in order to advance her position, she needed to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was unattainable and not expected of male engineers. despite positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department where she continues to work today, according to her suit. the lawsuit said tesla also denied her overtime pay, rest breaks and meal periods when she worked in sales, and retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower? when she raised concerns about cars ?sold in a defective state?.some of her claims of mistreatment echo those that have recently emerged from tesla factory workers, who allege that they have to work long hours for low wages in unsafe conditions. musk has vigorously denied those claims and criticized an effort by workers to unionize. tesla initially declined to respond to the guardian?s questions about vandermeyden?s claims, but after publication of this report, released a statement on tuesday defending its actions and refuting her allegations. a spokesperson said that tesla had hired a ?neutral third party? last year to investigate her accusations and that an ?exhaustive review of the facts? concluded her ?claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated?.the company added in its statement: ?tesla is committed to creating a positive workplace environment that is free of discrimination for all our employees.?therese lawless, vandermeyden?s lawyer, criticized the investigation, saying, ?we did not believe that it was a comprehensive report ... we vehemently disagree with their finding.?vandermeyden?s suit said she has suffered ?mental distress? and ?humiliation?.in an interview, she said it takes a toll on her knowing that her work is undervalued. ?equal pay is something that is essentially in the back of your mind every single day,? she said. ?you have all these data points showing how you?ve exceeded some of the predecessors and improved on the system. it wears on you.?

"on monday evening, donald trump gave a speech to the   th national boy scout jamboree in west virginia. although he came armed with a prepared speech about the merits of scouting ? each us president serves as the group?s honorary president ? and declared at the start that he would not talk about politics, trump went predictably off-script to talk about some favourite topics. and politics.boy, you have a lot of people. the press will say it?s about     people. it looks like about   ,    people.tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in washington dc that you have been hearing about with the fake news and all of that ? who the hell wants to talk about politics when i?m in front of the boy scouts?today i said we oughta change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer, but it?s not good.the scouts believe in putting america first.the vice-president of the united states, mike pence ? good guy ? was a scout and it meant so much to him. some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when mike was the governor of indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. and by the way, where are our indiana scouts tonight? i wonder if the television cameras will follow you; they don?t like doing that when they see these massive crowds. they don?t like doing that. hi folks. a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. a lot of love and a lot of love for our country. there?s a lot of love for our country.by the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible, massive crowd, record-setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? one per cent or zero? the fake media will say: president trump ? and you know what this is ? president trump spoke before a small crowd of boy scouts today. that?s some ? that is some crowd. fake media. fake news. thank you.secretary tom price is also here ? and hopefully he?s going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this thing known as obamacare that?s really hurting us, folks.by the way, are you going to get the votes? he better get them. he better get them. oh, he better ? otherwise i?ll say, tom, you?re fired. i?ll get somebody. he better get senator capito [republican west virginia senator shelley moore capito] to vote for it. you got to get the other senators to vote for it. it?s time. after seven years of saying repeal and replace obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. they better do it.by the way, just a question, did president obama ever come to a jamboree? and we?ll be back. we?ll be back. the answer is no, but we?ll be back.i have to tell you our economy is doing great. our stock market has picked up since the election november  . do we remember that date? was that a beautiful date? what a date. do you remember that famous night on television, november  , where they said ? these dishonest people ? where they said there is no path to victory for donald trump? ? but do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the republicans are red and the democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable and they didn?t know what to say? and you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college ? popular vote is much easier.so i have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make america great again.and by the way, under the trump administration, you?ll be saying merry christmas again when you go shopping. believe me. merry christmas. they?ve been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. you?re going to be saying merry christmas again, folks.i?ll tell you a story that?s very interesting for me when i was young. there was a man named william levitt, levitttowns, you have some here, you have some in different states ? and he was a very successful man. he was a homebuilder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful ?and he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. at the time especially, this was a long time ago, sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. and he went out and bought a big yacht and he had a very interesting life. i won?t go any more than that because you?re boy scouts, i?m not going to tell you what he did ? should i tell you? should i tell you? oh, you?re boy scouts, but you know life, you know life. so, look at you, who would think this is the boy scouts, right?so he had a very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate. and they didn?t know anything about building homes, and they didn?t know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it, and the scraps of wood ? so they called william levitt up and they said, would you like to buy back your company and he said yes, i would. he so badly wanted it, he got bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the south of france and other places ? but what happened is he bought back his company and he bought back a lot of empty land ? and in the end he failed and he failed badly. lost all of his money. he went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older.and i saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad. because the hottest people in new york were at this party. it was the party of steve ross. steve ross, he was one of the great people. he came up and discovered ? really founded ? time warner, and he was a great guy. he had a lot of successful people at the party. and i was doing well so i got invited to the party.[this is a much abbreviated version: you can read the full levitt reminiscence here and here.]","us president donald trump used his speech to the   th national boy scouts jamboree in west virginia to attack ""fake media"" for allegedly misquoting crowd size at his events. trump also urged his audience of    to   -year-olds to boo his presidential rival hillary clinton and predecessor barack obama. trump was slammed for using the traditional address for political endorsements.

"as india and other countries await an automatic exchange of information from next year about suspected black money hoarders in swiss banks, switzerland has said it can suspend such sharing of details at any time if confidentiality is not maintained. as part of an international commitment to fight the black money menace, switzerland has effected the automatic exchange of information standard since january  ,     . the sharing of details under this framework will begin from next year with the first batch of countries, including india. ""domestic financial institutions are collecting this data for the first time this year, and the swiss tax authorities will exchange it with their counterparts in partner states in     ,"" said the state secretariat for international financial matters (sif). the swiss agency is mandated to defend the interests of switzerland on international financial and tax matters and participates in international negotiations. it said in its latest quarterly newsletter that necessary steps will be in place to ensure the exchanged data do not fall into the wrong hands or get misused. ""switzerland is prepared in principle to introduce the automatic exchange of information with all states and territories which meet the relevant requirements. in this sense, the confidentiality and security of the data are important elements of this international standard,"" it said. ""switzerland implements the automatic reciprocal exchange of information only with countries which can guarantee confidentiality and data protection. before any exchanges occur, the global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes carries out a thorough examination as to whether or not the partner states which have undertaken to introduce the automatic exchange of information comply with the requirements."" ""in some important cases, switzerland additionally gets an on-the-spot impression of the situation in the partner states. given that switzerland does not belong to the group of countries which implemented the standard early on (so-called early adopters), it is also benefiting from the experience of other countries,"" the sif said. ""before the first exchange occurs, it will be able to examine if all significant elements of the standard have been met. should it subsequently transpire that a country has not fulfilled its obligations, switzerland can at any time suspend the automatic exchange of information with the country concerned,"" it added.system in place 'relatively simple' the swiss agency further said the system in place so far has been ""relatively simple"", wherein whenever a foreign tax authority was interested in obtaining information located in switzerland, it had to make a request for administrative assistance. ""however, the rapid international developments in recent years have provided switzerland with two new forms of exchange of information in the area of taxes: spontaneous and automatic exchange of information (aeoi),"" it added. in the case of the aeoi, countries mutually exchange information automatically on financial accounts and the details in this case are determined as the standards drawn up by the oecd. the information in spontaneous exchange needs to be exchanged if the transmitting country suspects that the information available might be of interest to another country. while spontaneous exchange has nothing to do with voluntary in this context -- it only means that no preliminary request has been submitted -- this framework was being handled very differently from country to country up to now, the sif said. ""within the scope of the oecd and g   project to combat base erosion and profit shifting (beps), the spontaneous exchange of information was specified for the first time in the area of advance tax rulings, where there is a risk of base erosion or profit shifting."" ""the federal council adopted the current international standard in this area in the context of a revision of the tax administrative assistance ordinance. switzerland will spontaneously exchange information on advance tax rulings for the first time next year,"" it added. 'number of domestic swiss bank branches has halved' the agency further said that over the past    years, the number of domestic bank branches in switzerland has almost halved. ""a reduction in the number of banking institutions and their branches can be the result of mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies. a number of policy measures have been put in place by swiss authorities in recent years to address concerns of its banks providing high secrecy walls around their global clients. new rules make it much easier for several foreign jurisdictions, including india, to get details from switzerland about people suspected to be involved in tax evasion and other financial crimes. switzerland has also been issuing notices to several resident indians and even indians settled abroad after the receipt of request from india for ""administrative assistance"", including information about their swiss bank account details. as per the local law, switzerland gives an opportunity to the entity concerned to challenge the sharing of information, before providing the assistance to the requesting nation. while india and switzerland late last year signed a new pact for automatic exchange of information about account details      onwards, the pending requests have been made under their existing bilateral tax treaty. the pace of seeking such details seems to have quickened in recent months, going by the sudden spurt in the number of indian names figuring in such notifications. also read | switzerland to share info on indians holding swiss bank accounts","following india's agreement on automatic exchange of information from next year about suspected black money hoarders in swiss banks, switzerland said it can suspend such exchange if confidentiality is not maintained. further, the swiss agency, mandated to defend the interests of switzerland on international financial matters, said steps will be taken to ensure exchanged data doesn't get misused."

""}}anees bazmee?s welcome is one of the most underrated comedies of recent times. however, over the years, it has become one of the most watched films on tv.in fact, its situational comedy is a lesson in comic timing and how to carry off a slapstick humour. this amazingly funny film revolves around an eligible bachelor who falls in love with a gangster?s sister, and how he creates confusion to have his way. since then, bazmee has directed singh is kinng, no problem, thank you, ready and welcome back. all these films had the theme of marriage at the centre.watch: our facebook live discussion on mubarakan, indu sarkar and raag deshbazmee?s latest mubarakan follows a similar trajectory, with a double-role angle. separated in childhood, twins, karan and charan (both played by arjun kapoor) are expected to marry as per their guardians? wishes, but they are already in love with sweety (ileana d?cruz) and nafisa (neha sharma).things get complicated when charan gets engaged to a another girl, binkal (athiya shetty) in london. the shy guy couldn?t gather the courage to tell his parents about his love life and that leads to a big-intra family feud that ends when charan?s uncle swears to marry him off in exactly one month.however, kartar singh (anil kapoor) is yet to arrive and add more confusion to the already-messed up affair.mubarakan is a typical bazmee film which starts with loud background music and solid bass. the hero walks in slow motion and dances to peppy tunes, but shows a docile attitude in front of the heroine. arjun kapoor takes a cue from akshay kumar in welcome and jumps into this mad-caper wholeheartedly. it?s just that anil kapoor is a pro at it and steals all the limelight from him.his character drives a vehicle that has slogans like ?buri nazar wale tera muh gora? and ?you are chasing a punjabi? written all over it. he then employs an english man who mouths dialogues like ?baadshaho tussi lassi pio? and ?meri pagar padhao.? most of us don?t expect any sort of explanations from such a film, so it keeps moving from chandigarh to london in a jiffy with songs thrown in occasionally. they?re anyway needed to hold attention in this    -minute film.you also find dialogues like, ?ye zaroor druggie hai? ye punjab se aaya hai.? then somebody casually mentions, ?udta punjab,? and everybody starts laughing.anil kapoor, however, tries his best to hold the family and the story together. as someone who unknowingly keeps creating chaos, he has been rightly given a good screen time. the only actor who outperforms in a couple of scenes is pavan malhotra. as an always angry hotelier who hates to be seen down upon, he is hilarious.mubarakan shows some witty character sketches before losing its charm in the later half. the indecisive arjun kapoor and self-musing anil kapoor successfully establish a mood where you don?t mind dialogues like, ?iss baar christmas    ko hai?? or, ?ye mooli, maamooli nahi hai.? in fact, you laugh when somebody falls off a window while trying to find the mobile network. well, i did.unfortunately, such moments keep getting fewer in number in the second half as the film gets totally centred on anil kapoor and his antics. unlike welcome, he doesn?t get much support from his co-actors and gigs become repetitive in nature.some of priyadarshan?s most likeable comedies also deal with an army of actors and a confusing thread in the climax, but he doesn?t waste much time in clearing the confusion. bazmee takes time here as some of his characters go for long monologues. this slows down the pace and gives the audience a chance to realise the loopholes in the otherwise over-simplified story.mubarakan is designed as a family film where comedy is generated through quarrelling relatives. this works initially but goes out of control later.but that doesn?t mean you won?t be entertained. you?ll be occasionally laughing, but probably won?t be leaving the theatre with a big smile on your face.interact with rohit vats at twitter/@nawabjha","the arjun kapoor and anil kapoor starrer 'mubarakan' which released on friday ""shows some witty character sketches before losing its charm"", wrote hindustan times. ndtv wrote, ""the film goes overboard with its excessive cheeriness...into the realms of inanity"", while times of india called the film's three actresses ""decorative set-pieces"". it was rated  . /  (ht),  /  (ndtv) and  /  (toi)."
