"a stretch of coral reef off mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.the reef, off the coast of cancun, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but their condition has deteriorated in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the acidification of the oceans.under the cancun insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company swiss re and the nature conservancy, a us environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $ m (     ,   ) and $ . m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a    mile (  km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored. if any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $  m to $  m in any given year.any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. the advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. as well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.the cancun scheme, which is to be run by swiss re and the nature conservancy, with backing from the mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the ?eco-system services? provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. it could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. this is scheduled to be activated in september, with further contracts to be signed in november and december, and full coverage will then begin from next january.?public-private partnerships are the key,? said mark tercek, chief executive of the nature conservancy, in an interview with the guardian. he predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the cancun scheme begins formal operation.?i used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],? said tercek. ?we have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.?tercek said the cancun scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be ?very scalable around the world?.a future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change.","insurance giant swiss re is preparing an insurance policy for the mesoamerican reef in mexico to prevent its further deterioration, reports said. under the scheme, which is reportedly the first for a natural structure, the premiums will be paid by hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.n"

" of all the rules at wimbledon ? and there are many ? surely none is more outdated than one referring to players? clothing. not the part that insists they should wear ?almost entirely white? attire, something players do not mind. but rather the one that refers to the colour of their underwear and how visible it is during play. first venus williams was asked to change her pink bra in a first-round match, which drew a suitably clipped response to a media inquiry: ?i don?t like talking about bras in press conferences. it?s weird.? on wednesday, four junior doubles players were asked to change their underwear because it could be seen under their white shorts, and on thursday the   ?year?old austrian jurij rodionov was asked by a supervisor to show her his underwear. ?yesterday i wore black pants and nobody said anything and today i wore blue and suddenly it?s a problem,? he said. ?it was a big surprise for me.? rodionov said wimbledon provided him with two white pairs. ?one was a little bit too big but these ones were ok,? he said. asked if the rule was outdated, he said: ?wimbledon is always special. maybe it?s a little bit too much but i like that the players only have to wear white. it?s tradition.?on the eve of the championships, andre agassi said he did not want to consult novak djokovic?s former coach boris becker to get an idea of what to expect as he began his new role working with the serb, because he was trying to avoid going in with any preconceptions. that is definitely not the case for jonas bjorkman, who has been coaching marin cilic since august of last year. the swede was spotted chatting to cilic?s former long?term coach bob brett after the croat?s victory against gilles muller, possibly about how to get the better of sam querrey in the semi-finals.magdalena rybarikova captured the imagination of the wimbledon crowds with her run to the semi?finals, the first time she had been beyond the third round of any of the grand slam tournament. it was big news in slovakia but she is not going to have any trouble walking around without being noticed, it seems. while doing a tv interview the day before her defeat by garbine muguruza, several people walked past without even spotting her. at the same time the nine-times champion martina navratilova, wearing a hat, was chased down the street outside wimbledon by two people who had not fallen for the (slim) disguise.","boys' doubles top seeds, hungary's zsombor piros and china's wu yibing, were asked to change their non-white underwear at wimbledon on wednesday, because it was not compliant with the all-white dress code. the boys were checked by the umpire during their match and given a pair to change into. on thursday, another player was checked for wearing a non-white underwear."

who in six months has now lost a chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, national security adviser, communications director and press secretary ? added on twitter: ?i would like to thank reince priebus for his service and dedication to his country. we accomplished a lot together and i am proud of him!?according to a pooled report, trump sent the tweets shortly after air force one landed back at joint base andrews, maryland, following a trip to long island, new york. priebus and scaramucci were also on the flight.in a statement, the white house press secretary, sarah huckabee sanders, said: ?general john kelly is one of the true stars of the administration. he has helped seal the border and reduced illegal immigration by   %. he is respected by everyone, especially the people at the department of homeland security.?the entire administration loves him and no one is comparable. he will begin on monday morning and a cabinet meeting will follow his swearing in monday morning.?she added: ?the president thanks reince priebus for his service. they accomplished a lot together. he was loyal in his dedication to the president. the president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country, and he will always be a member of the trump team.?sanders then spoke to reporters outside her office. asked if the decision was priebus?s or trump?s, she replied: ?we all serve at the pleasure of the president. the conversations about this started with the president and reince about two weeks ago, in terms of timing.?she denied that the change had anything do with scaramucci, and said trump and kelly had been ?talking about it for a while?.on friday, priebus said in a statement: ?it has been one of the greatest honours of my life to serve this president and our country. i want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. i will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president?s agenda and policies. i can?t think of a better person than john kelly to succeed me and i wish him god?s blessings and great success.?in an interview with cnn just two hours after his departure was announced, priebus paid homage to trump. ?i am going to honor the president every day,?

"boston, dec    (pti) scientists have used the smallest possible bits of diamonds to assemble electrical wires just three atoms wide, an advance that could pave the way for fabrics that generate electricity. by grabbing various types of atoms and putting them together lego-style, the new technique could potentially be used to build tiny wires for a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic devices that employ both electricity and light and superconducting materials that conduct electricity without any loss. ""what we have shown here is that we can make tiny, conductive wires of the smallest possible size that essentially assemble themselves,"" said hao yan, postdoctoral researcher at stanford university in the us. ""the process is a simple, one-pot synthesis. you dump the ingredients together and you can get results in half an hour. its almost as if the diamondoids know where they want to go,"" said yan. this animation shows molecular building blocks joining the tip of a growing nanowire. each block consists of a diamondoid - the smallest bit of diamond - attached to sulphur and copper atoms. like lego blocks, they only fit together in certain ways that are determined by their size and shape. the copper and sulphur atoms form a conductive wire in the middle, and the diamondoids form an insulating outer shell. although there are other ways to get materials to self-assemble, this is the first one shown to make a nanowire with a solid, crystalline core that has good electronic properties, said nicholas melosh, from the us department of energys slac national accelerator laboratory. the needle-like wires have a semiconducting core - a combination of copper and sulphur known as a chalcogenide - surrounded by the attached diamondoids, which form an insulating shell. their size is important because a material that exists in just one or two dimensions - as atomic-scale dots, wires or sheets - can have very different, extraordinary properties compared to the same material made in bulk, melosh said. the new method allows researchers to assemble those materials with atom-by-atom precision and control. the diamondoids they used as assembly tools are tiny, interlocking cages of carbon and hydrogen. found naturally in petroleum fluids, they are extracted and separated by size and geometry in a slac laboratory. for this study, the research team took advantage of the fact that diamondoids are strongly attracted to each other, through what are known as van der waals forces. they started with the smallest possible diamondoids - single cages that contain just    carbon atoms - and attached a sulphur atom to each. ","stanford scientists have used the smallest possible diamond bits (diamondoids) to assemble atoms into three-atom-wide electrical wires. the core of each block of the nanowire is formed by copper and sulphur atoms, while diamondoids form the insulating outer shell. the technique could be used for making fabrics that produce electricity and optoelectronic devices that employ both current and light."

"dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by president donald trump?s administration will lose more than $    million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years.the administration?s assessment is in sharp contrast with that of the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists, which credited the program with contributing to an all-time low rate of teen pregnancies.rachel fey of the national campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy said tuesday that grantees under the teen pregnancy prevention program were given no explanation when notified this month their awards will end next june. the program, begun under president barack obama?s administration, receives about $    million a year.?we know so little about the rationale behind cutting short these grants,?

acog president dr. haywood brown said.the north texas alliance to reduce unintended pregnancy in teens, one of more than    current grantees around the country, will lose just under $  million a year, about three-quarters of its budget, executive director terry goltz greenberg said. the program worked with more than  ,    kids last year in high-poverty neighborhoods where the teen birth rates are three to five times the national average, she said.?most of the evidence-based programs are not just talking about contraception but are putting it in the context of bigger goals in life, such as, ?where do you want to be in three years?? ?how does a kid fit into that,?? she said.elizabeth gomez,   , said the texas program?s after-school classes taught her how to discuss difficult topics with her three daughters in a respectful way that made them listen and respond.?for hispanics, it?s difficult, because it?s a taboo to talk about sex,?

"he studied agriculture in rural england and was tipped by some as china?s future leader.but on tuesday morning sun zhengcai?s political obituary was splashed across the front page of the communist party?s official mouthpiece in a damning editorial entitled: ?rule strictly over the party with iron discipline.??the investigation into comrade sun zhengcai sounds the alarm bell for the party,? the people?s daily article warned, as it announced that the youngest member of china?s political elite had been ejected from power for a ?serious violation of discipline?.?top cadres must hold firm political positions, temper their political characters ? and act in a manner consistent with the party?s central committee with [president] xi jinping as its core,? the broadsheet declared. just a few weeks ago, sun, a   -year-old former agriculture minister who studied farming at hertfordshire?s rothamstad research centre in the     s, was the high-flying party chief of one of the world?s fastest-growing cities, the sweltering yangtze port of chongqing.many believed he was being groomed for greatness and would use that job ? handed to him in late      after the sensational downfall of flamboyant party leader bo xilai ? as a springboard from which to leap into one of seven highly-coveted spots on china?s top ruling body, the politburo standing committee. places on that elite council will be up for grabs later this year when chinese leaders flock to beijing for their quinquennial enclave, the   th communist party congress.such a promotion would likely have put sun ? part of the so-called sixth generation of post-revolution leaders ? in line to succeed either xi or premier li keqiang at the next party congress in     .but xi?s unforeseen decision to purge sun has shredded not only those expectations but also the playbook governing how one-party china conducts political leadership successions. in doing so, some experts fear xi may also have set in motion a new phase of political turbulence in the world?s number two economy.?a smooth leadership transition is really crucial to the survival of chinese communist party rule in china and this really throws a monkey wrench into the machine,? said susan shirk, a us expert in elite chinese politics who was deputy assistant secretary of state under bill clinton.shirk said that for almost two decades china?s rulers had abided by an unofficial succession system designed to prevent both cut-throat and destabilising internecine power struggles and the rise of strongman dictators who could cling to power until they died or were violently overthrown.according to those unwritten rules, presumptive heirs to the communist party?s top two jobs, general secretary and premier, should be informally anointed five years ahead of a full leadership transition, as had happened with xi and li in     . some had seen sun as one of those two likely heirs ? the other was guangdong party chief hu chunhua, who remains in power ? and the decision to bring him down now brought ?intense uncertainty about how the game will be played in the future?, shirk said. ?i think that has got to make the people at the top ranks of the chinese communist party very uneasy about the risks that presents.?as with much about chinese politics, the exact nature of sun?s alleged crimes remains murky, as does the political rationale behind his defenestration.the first hint of his undoing came when one of xi?s feared corruption-busting teams descended on chongqing late last year. in its subsequent report the group accused his administration of failing to eliminate the poisonous and pernicious ?ideological legacy? of bo xilai, a bitter xi rival, who had been ousted five years earlier after the murder of british businessman neil heywood sparked china?s biggest political scandal in decades. then, in mid-july, came the unexpected and unexplained announcement that sun had been replaced by a xi loyalist who vowed to purify the city?s ?political ecosystem?. sun is rumoured to have been taken into custody while attending a conference in beijing.cheng li, the director of the brookings institute?s china center, said it was unclear if sun was facing accusations of corruption or political offences such as conspiring against xi: ?it could be either ? or both.?many believe xi, who some suspect hopes to stay in power beyond     , viewed sun as a power-hungry competitor who had to be eliminated. li, an authority on the communist party?s elite, said that even before the purge: ?i have talked to many people who know sun [and they said] ? ?that guy has a very strong personal ambition; you simply cannot believe what he says and what he promises?.?in chinese, you use the term ?you? [slippery or cunning].?bill bishop, the publisher of the influential sinocism newsletter, said sun?s demise was further proof that xi ? who took power in      and has been called china?s most dominant leader since mao ? was a masterful and steely political strategist.as he sought to cement his status as china?s omnipotent ?chairman of everything?, xi was using anti-corruption investigators to pick off rivals, who were replaced with supporters. sun?s successor in chongqing, chen min?er, who worked under xi during his five years as zhejiang province?s party boss, now appears poised to claim a seat at the party?s top table at this autumn?s congress.?xi certainly looks like he would make machiavelli ? and mao ? quite proud,? bishop said.shirk, the chair of the   st century china centre at the university of california, san diego, said she saw sun?s downfall not as as sign of xi?s strength, but of the fragility of china?s political system. ?if [xi] upturns the smooth succession now, i think he?s setting himself up for trouble, for some pushback from the rest of the party elite.?if they feel they are being put at risk and the whole party is being put at risk by a leader who is trying to claim too much of the power and privilege for himself, then i think there is a risk.?i?m not saying it is necessarily an elite coup or something like that, but it could be.?for sun zhengcai, there is little doubt what now lies ahead.?he?ll end up in jail,? said li.additional reporting by wang zhen","top communist party of china politician sun zhengcai, who was considered a potential successor to president xi jinping, is reportedly being investigated for corruption by his party. the probe against zhengcai, who was recently ejected from his role as party's secretary for chongqing city, eliminates him from the contest to become china's next president."

"the bodies washed up with grim regularity on the banks of the tigris downstream from mosul, a daily reminder of the vicious fight against islamic state that played out a few dozen miles away.all were heavily decomposed, most bound and blindfolded, some mutilated. the corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of qayyarah.?i see dead bodies in the water daily,? said ahmed mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. ?the number has increased since early april. there were five bodies floating in the river recently in one single day. they are young men with their hands tied behind their back and are blindfolded.?iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi this week declared victory after nearly nine months of fierce fighting to displace the extremist group from the city where it proclaimed its ?caliphate? in     . but as mosul lies in ruins ? and the last women and children emerge from the rubble ? a bloody picture of the campaign?s impact is emerging. local people who spotted corpses midstream would try to catch them and then call the army, mohammed said. soldiers then take them to a makeshift morgue at the city?s general hospital, run by mansour maroof mansour. most of the dead found in the river with some identifiable features intact were young men who appeared to be in their late   s, said mansour, but he has learned little else about who they were. ?we can?t identify the bodies in the river. they are very decomposed and there is nothing on them to use for identification,? he said, standing in a room filled with dozens of bodybags. none had been claimed, and even that toll of the unknown dead is not exhaustive; some bodies are lost.?(once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier,? said the driver mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the tigris river. human rights watch (hrw) said evidence points to government forces, killing suspected isis members or collaborators without trial or due process.warning of the killings in april, lama fakih, deputy middle east director for hrw said: ?the bodies of bound and blindfolded men are being found one after the other in and around mosul and in the tigris river, raising serious concerns about extrajudicial killings by government forces. the lack of any apparent government action to investigate these deaths undermines the government?s statements on protecting detainee rights.?little has been done to investigate the killings, however. ?the horrors that the people of mosul have witnessed and the disregard for human life by all parties to this conflict must not go unpunished,? lynn maalouf, research director for amnesty international in the middle east, said. the violence upstream casts a long shadow in qayyarah, which was freed from isis rule at the start of the nine-month mosul campaign. most residents are reluctant even to talk about the bodies in the river. ?i don?t know anything about that subject,? said one fishmonger in the newly re-opened market, buzzing with soldiers and militia fighters.isis exploited iraq?s sectarian tensions to facilitate its rise to power. many sunnis who felt disenfranchised by the shia majority government or feared becoming targets of security forces welcomed or at least tolerated the group?s arrival in     . as the extremism and violence of isis world view became clearer, many sunnis left or privately turned against the group, but suspicions of collaboration linger and in some sunni areas a sense of apprehension remains.?blood for blood,? reads graffiti on a wall of a house in qayyarah that locals say belonged to ali khether, a well-known isis commander who had lived in the town. he is described by one as ?the child of adultery, ali khether, the daeshi? ? a name that refers to daesh, a pejorative name for isis.close by stands the town?s small stadium where isis, with the aid of local people, killed dozens, with the most cursory of trials, on charges ranging from spying for the security services to homosexualitynow as isis retreats to the syrian city of raqqa and desert areas of western iraq, those who were on the receiving end of their brutality for over two years have set up their own militia groups. loosely attached to the popular mobilisation units (pmu), they are taking the law into their own hands.?pmu militias have carried out a systematic pattern of violations, including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings and torture of sunni arab men and boys, seemingly in revenge for is attacks,? said amnesty international in a report earlier this year.security forces who retook the town found the bodies of many isis victims that had been dumped in the river, said walid khaled an officer at qayyarah police station, but he had no idea who the more recent waves of dead might be. ?we don?t know where they come from, they are unidentified,? he said.some in the town say the bodies are more isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in mosul, but the iraqi security forces had blocked the river around   km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water. territory further down river towards qayyarah has been in the control of iraqi security forces for months.a soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting munirah village, around   km south of mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.he showed the guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water. ?he was daesh hiding in the reeds and we killed him,? the soldier said with satisfaction.","unidentified dead bodies are spotted floating almost daily in the tigris river near the recently isis-liberated iraqi city of mosul, according to reports. the bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of isis militants by the iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation human rights watch has alleged. soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital."

""}}but the virus had a side-effect. it made simians ? apes, chimps, monkeys of all sorts ? evolve quicker than they were meant to. soon, like most oppressed beings suddenly empowered, they fought back. they were led in that first battle by an ape named caesar, who had seen the compassion mankind was capable of, but also the cruelty.it?s been fifteen years since the fight on the golden gate bridge, a fight the apes won, but after which they were forced to leave the dangerous cities. caesar, battle-worn and scarred, has taken his apes, and his family, into the woods, where they lay in hiding, one eye always glancing over their shoulder for the last remnants of humanity to attack.word has travelled over the snowy mountains that a violent militia has been formed by a cruel man, a man who calls himself the colonel, like apocalypse now?s kurtz, utterly consumed by insanity. he has imprisoned hundreds of apes at his large compound, which lies at the foot of snowy, forested mountains. he makes them work, under his boot-heels, tamed to the sound of his whip. he has madness in his eyes, they say. a torn, tattered american flag hangs limply off his balcony, from where, like schindler?s list?s amon goth, he surveys his kingdom through a lens.he wants them to build a wall.war for the planet of the apes is the rare blockbuster that arrives once, maybe twice every year. in     , we haven?t seen a better one since logan, a film with which it shares several similarities ? a hero driven by duty, a mute young girl whom he must protect, and a sombre tone that will surely test the patience of some audience members. but that?s what made me like it more.with this, matt reeves has made his fourth, unquestionably great movie. his grip on the war movie tone, aided by stunning, almost biblically grand visuals and music by two michaels, seresin and giacchino, firmly establish him as one of the finest directors working within the studio system today. it might even be the first great post-human movie ? for more reasons than one. technically, because it signals the arrival of an era in cinema where human actors could quite possibly be made obsolete, and thematically, because it suggests that human beings are a scourge that needs to be destroyed.over the three films that span several decades, the planet of the apes reboot series tells an epic story of one creature?s rise, but it is also a shakespearean tragedy ? a cautionary tale that chronicles the slow death of an entire species: mankind.our hubris, it suggests, is the reason behind our downfall. we have been led to believe, ever since we were little children, ignorant and malleable, that we are the apex predators, that we occupy the throne at the top of the food chain. this is a lie. we are simply at that stage in the evolution of our planet at which we happen to be the most intelligent life forms living on it. faced with the prospect of billions of more years? worth of evolution, we could easily be overtaken by an even more intelligent species ? perhaps one of our own making.like bong joon-ho?s terrific okja, a film that could very easily be its close cousin, war for the planet of the apes harbours an unshakable contempt for humanity. and along with its immediate predecessor, the quietly brilliant dawn for the planet of the apes, it firmly believes that we are beyond redemption, and that the only thing to do is for us to gracefully die out.but what are we without our fighting spirit? what are we without our silly delusions and false confidence? it?s what makes us human, dammit! so foolishly, we fight, even in the face of inevitable defeat, without realising ? and this is crucial ? that more often than not, we are the villains. in this particular situation, that face of inevitable defeat looks like an angry ape?s.and what an intricate work of art it is. crafted by hundreds of immensely talented people, sculpted around a flawless central performance by andy serkis, a maverick and a maven. if this doesn?t get him an academy award nomination, then we must rally the troops, and like a bunch of apes, protest till they start firing arrows at our sides, yelling ?apes, together, strong,? till we die.watch the war for the planet of the apes trailer herefollow @htshowbiz for morethe author tweets @rohannaahar","science fiction film 'war for the planet of the apes' which released on friday, ""is the rare blockbuster that arrives once, maybe twice every year"", wrote hindustan times. times of india said, ""[it's] a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that balances action and special effects"", while mid-day described it as ""brilliantly-scripted"". it was rated  . /  (ht),  /  (toi),  . /  (mid-day)."

" the prime minister?s office has paid around rs    lakh to the indian air force for flying narendra modi on     ?non-official? domestic trips since he took office, an expense that was lower than what it would have been had the pm used through commercial providers.the trips were largely for electioneering, and india?s election code makes it must for ministers ? including the pm ? to reimburse the government if its machinery is used in such cases. the flights provided by iaf were mostly when the prime minister had to fly out to remote locations in helicopters or small planes instead of his usual mode of air transport: the air india one. the rates for these flights were last revised by the defence ministry in     .in all, the iaf provided details of     non-official flights taken by the pm from may      till february     , when modi was on a whirlwind tour of election-bound states that included uttar pradesh, bihar, west bengal, maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand and assam, the right to information reply provided by the air force to commodore (retired) lokesh k batra said. the disclosures could cause some unease among bharatiya janata party?s rivals, who can claim that the lower rates put the pm?s party at an advantage with respect to election spending.in his application, batra asked the iaf about the domestic visits by the pm and the mode of payment. he also sought details of the rules under which the pm is allowed to use iaf planes for domestic visits.quoting the rules, the iaf said no charge will be recovered for use of aircraft by the president, vice-president, the prime minister (except when he/she travels otherwise than on official duty), the ministers of defence and home and senior defence ministry officials for defence purposes. the reply said the rates will be calculated at commercial rates if the destination is linked by a regular commercial air service and, in other cases, with reference to per passenger per kilometres rates notified by the defence ministry. the reply said the rates were last notified in     .the pmo paid the air force rs   ,    for a delhi-gorakhpur-delhi flight and rs  ,    for mangalore-kasargod-mangalore flight, which private chartered airline operators said was lower than the commercial rate. the cost for delhi-rohtak-sonipat-ambala trip was rs  ,  ,   , and the pmo paid rs   ,    for kolkata-balasore-kalaikunda-balasore-kalaikunda-bagdogra-guwahati flight. cost of some flights like calicut-vikram ground was just rs  ,   .?it is surprising that the pmo has paid for pm?s non-official visits which were for electioneering. as per election rules, his party (bjp) should have paid the money,? batra said. bjp sources, however, said that the money is paid to the pmo and is shown in the election expenditure report submitted to the election commission.","according to an rti reply, prime minister's office has paid around ?   lakh to indian air force for flying narendra modi on     ""non-official"" domestic trips since he took office. the rates for these flights were last revised     , which makes them cheaper to travel in than the commercial flights. the trips were majorly taken by pm to election-bound states."

"the   th chief of the indian air force (iaf), air chief marshal arup raha today addressed a press conference he termed as 'customary' for an outgoing air chief. though many from the press corps disagreed, it made for a candid interaction with the man who has been at the helm of not just the iaf for three full years but also was the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee (cosc), the apex tri-service body for nearly    months.key excerpts:iaf's fighter planes: the teeth of any air force is in its fighter planes. the government has allowed us    squadrons. as of now, we have a large number of sukhoi    (   squadrons inducted and three more will be done soon). we are doing a mid life upgrade and we foresee them to be around for the next    years. the light combat aircraft (lca) tejas is a good, fourth generation plus aircraft. the rafale is an excellent aircraft which will prove its worth in any scenario. we have just signed up for    planes. in the next  -   years time, we need more. one more line of aircraft production is required in india under the make in india program. need about     fighters over next  -   years. we have enough heavy fighters (like sukhoi) but we need more in the medium segment.worst moment: it came when i heard about the an   missing with    personnel. we searched a lot, undertook     sorties, over      flying hours. we had about    targets which look like the an   debris. we have underwater assets which can search till the depth of  . km from the surface. from   , there are now just    targets which remain to be verified. the underwater equipment to search could not do its job because there was a technical issue. we have approached the government to contract agencies from abroad who can search. most of the soviet era planes like the an   lack under water locator beacons. we have taken up with the government a case to procure such beacons. within a month or two, a contract signed to arm all planes with such beacons. i feel, the an   is not the best plane for this route. you can call it a mistake of not fitting these planes with the beacons.defence corruption: from time to time, issues have come up. the investigating agencies have not been able to pin down those involved. it is not only the armed forces personnel who are involved in procurement. it will be premature to say anything in the agustawestland case. that a former iaf chief has been arrested obviously has consequences and the law of the land has to be followed. however, an ex iaf chief is like a family member to us and till a person is convicted, let us give him his due. if convicted, there should be no sympathy.china reacting to agni v test: posturing will always be there. we should go about our task. unless there is something being done which is prohibited like nuclear proliferation which is also happening by the way in our neighbourhood, if we are legitimately developing our capability, i do not think anybody should object.on air to air refueling planes of the iaf: the aircraft we have for the job are not very good on serviceability. we need much more. unfortunately, anomalies came up and acquisition had been cancelled. very unfortunate but you can't help it.military diplomacy: we've done well. we convinced the government to step up military cooperation with nations in our neighbourhood, the saarc region, far-east. now the government is ready to sell them equipment too. this will help fill the void which our adversaries would have exploited.disaster response: we thought we may or may not fight a conventional war but we have to be there to serve our people. we have been the first responders in our international humanitarian missions. we have aided the governments be it during the jat agitation, running its mints   x  etc. we are also helping bsf, arc, paramilitary forces and anti-maoist operations.orop: the agitation was a setback. it affected the esteem of the armed forces. i could not stem the agitation. what the government has given is reasonably good. i have told my people to accept it. anomalies ought to resolved, including those from the seventh pay commission.post-pathankot: much has been discussed and we are implementing the lessons learnt. we are now well prepared to tackle terrorist attacks. a lot has been done in training, orientation, weapons are being improved, field-craft has been improved. we are training a large number of manpower. government has given us the authority to have    garud commando flights (each with    men) and    more have been sanctioned, taking it to total of    garud commando flights.","the outgoing indian air force chief arup raha on wednesday said the worst moment during his tenure was when he heard about an an-   plane going missing with    personnel on board. citing that the iaf undertook over  ,    flying hours to search for the plane, raha termed it as a mistake of not fitting an-  s with underwater locator beacons."

""i totally agree with murthy that it was not proper. we should have indian norm for compensation; we cant follow american norm, we (infosys) are not an american company,"" pai, who was also formerly chief finance officer of infosys, told pti in a telephonic interview. the comments come at a time when a row has erupted again between some founders and the current management of the firm. pai argued that at a time when the salary for entry level software engineers had not been raised in the it industry in india for the past seven years, it is totally wrong to hike the compensation for top-level executives. ""the starting salary for software engineers has not gone up for the past seven years; and the inflation in the last seven years is about    per cent,"" he said. the salary of chief operating officer (of infosys) three-four years ago was rs  .  crore or rs   crore. now, it has gone up to rs    crore, according to the chairman of manipal global education services and aarin capital. ""i think unless people at the bottom (software engineers) get good, regular hike, paying people at the top for doing nothing...for long period of time is totally wrong,"" pai said. without naming rao, he said, ""that too we have been paying (compensation hike) for a person who has been in the company for    years."" ""if somebody has done spectacularly well, then its okay. performance is not spectacular. salary is spectacular,"" he said.

""the fundamental error was increasing ceos salary from usd   million to    million without any justification,"" pai further said. raising the ceos salary was the ""fundamental problem,"" and it could now lead to top-level executives and executive committee members seeking a pay hike, he said.

"australian police charged a top vatican cardinal on thursday with multiple counts of historical sexual assault offenses, a stunning decision certain to rock the highest levels of the holy see.cardinal george pell, pope francis' chief financial adviser and australia's most senior catholic, is the highest-ranking vatican official to ever be charged in the church's long-running sexual abuse scandal. pell said he would return to australia to fight the charges.victoria state police deputy commissioner shane patton said police have summonsed pell to appear in an australian court to face multiple charges of ""historical sexual assault offenses,"" meaning offenses that generally occurred some time ago. patton said there are multiple complainants against pell, but gave no other details on the allegations against the cardinal. pell was ordered to appear in melbourne magistrates court on july   .the catholic archdiocese of sydney issued a statement on behalf of pell, saying the   -year-old cardinal ""strenuously denied all allegations"" and would return to australia to clear his name.""he said he is looking forward to his day in court and will defend the charges vigorously,"" the statement said.patton told reporters in melbourne that none of the allegations against pell had been tested in any court, adding: ""cardinal pell, like any other defendant, has a right to due process.""the charges are a new and serious blow to pope francis, who has already suffered several credibility setbacks in his promised ""zero tolerance"" policy about sex abuse.for years, pell has faced allegations that he mishandled cases of clergy abuse when he was archbishop of melbourne and, later, sydney. his actions as archbishop came under intense scrutiny in recent years by a government-authorized investigation into how the catholic church and other institutions have responded to the sexual abuse of children. australia's royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse - the nation's highest form of inquiry - has found shocking levels of abuse in australia's catholic church, revealing earlier this year that   percent of catholic priests were accused of sexually abusing children over the past several decades.last year, pell acknowledged during his testimony to the commission that the catholic church had made ""enormous mistakes"" in allowing thousands of children to be raped and molested by priests over centuries. he conceded that he, too, had erred by often believing the priests over victims who alleged abuse. and he vowed to help end a rash of suicides that has plagued church abuse victims in his australian hometown of ballarat.but more recently, pell himself became the focus of a clergy sex abuse investigation, with victoria detectives flying to the vatican last year to interview the cardinal. it is unclear what allegations the charges announced thursday relate to, but two men, now in their   s, have said that pell touched them inappropriately at a swimming pool in the late     s, when pell was a senior priest in melbourne.'pell will return to australia'australia has no extradition treaty with the vatican. but in the statement from the sydney archdiocese, pell said he would return to australia ""as soon as possible,"" following advice and approval by his doctors. last year, pell declined to return to australia to testify for the third time before the royal commission, saying he was too ill to fly. he instead testified via video conference from rome.the charges put pope francis in a thorny position. in     , francis won cautious praise from victims' advocacy groups when he created a commission of outside experts to advise him and the broader church about ""best practices"" to fight abuse and protect children.but the commission has since lost much of its credibility after its two members who were survivors of abuse left. francis also scrapped the commission's signature proposal - a tribunal section to hear cases of bishops who covered up for abuse - after vatican officials objected.in addition, francis drew heated criticism for his      appointment of a chilean bishop accused by victims of helping cover up for chile's most notorious pedophile. the pope was later caught on videotape labeling the parishioners who opposed the nomination of being ""leftists"" and ""stupid.""when francis was asked last year about the accusations against pell, he said he wanted to wait for australian justice to take its course before judging. ""it's true, there is a doubt,"" he told reporters en route home from poland. ""we have to wait for justice and not first make a mediatic judgment - a judgment of gossip - because that won't help.""""once justice has spoken, i will speak,"" he said.francis appointed pell in      to a five-year term to head the vatican's new economy secretariat, giving him broad rein to control all economic, administrative, personnel and procurement functions of the holy see. the mandate has since been restricted to performing more of an oversight role.it remains to be seen how the pope will respond to the developments.given francis' credibility is on the line, any decision to keep pell on as prefect while facing charges would reflect poorly on francis, given he remains one of the pope's top advisers.at the same time, the vatican has a history of shielding its own: when cardinal bernard law resigned in disgrace in      over his cover-up of abuse in boston, victims expressed outrage that st. john paul ii gave him a plum position as archpriest of a rome basilica.the transfer spared law what would likely have been years of litigation and testimony in u.s. courts as victims sued the archdioceses for their abuse, though law himself was never criminally charged with wrongdoing.in the     s, the vatican refused to cooperate with italian investigators when one of its officials, archbishop paul c. marcinkus, was indicted over a banking scandal. the vatican successfully cited his diplomatic immunity.","pope francis' chief financial adviser and third-highest vatican official cardinal george pell was charged with multiple sexual assault offences on thursday. he is the highest-ranking vatican official to be charged in the church's long-running sexual abuse scandal. pell, accused of touching two boys inappropriately in a pool in the     s, has denied the allegations and vowed to ""clear his name."""

"two people were killed and many wounded in clashes that broke out during protests against  a power grid project in west bengal?s south    parganas district on tuesday, bringing back memories of the tumultuous days of anti-land acquisition agitations in singur and nandigram. both victims in bhangar died of bullet injuries, but villagers said police did not fire at them and alleged the involvement of supporters of the ruling trinamool congress, which blamed people ?against development? for the violence. in the previous left regime, there was an attempt to acquire land in bhangar, but the state government retreated in the face of fierce protests in singur and nandigram led by chief minister mamata banerjee, who was then the opposition leader.the situation had been tense in bhangar from monday evening, when police picked up two activists --- before releasing them an hour later under the instructions of top officials at the state secretariat. on tuesday morning, irate villagers vandalised police vehicles and set at least three buses on fire. they uprooted trees, blocked roads with the trunks and hurled brickbats at the police for hours. mofijul khan and alam mollah died in the firing that ensued. ?supporters of arabul islam (a local tmc leader) shot my brother,? alleged khan?s brother. cm banerjee rushed leaders such as rajya sabha mp mukul roy and minister abdur rezzak mollah to talk to the agitators, who demanded the cancellation of the project.the project, undertaken by the powergrid corporation of india, is nearing completion on a   -acre plot that was acquired a couple of years ago. villagers are also objecting to high-tension lines passing over their land. ?work on the project stands suspended,? power minister sovandeb chatterjee told ht. sharmistha chowdhury, one of the leaders of the movement, said the residents gathered at the site in the morning after a huge contingent of police entered the villages of khamar ait, nutanhaat and machhibhanga. ?as the police tried to disperse the gathering by firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets, the situation went out of control,? said chowdhury.the villagers? movement is spearheaded by jomi, jibika, poribesh o bastutantra raksha committee (committee to protect land, livelihood, environment and ecosystem). the committee is guided by cpi-ml (red star),?a little-known naxalite outfit. turning the tables on banerjee, the cpi-m came out in support of the farmers at bhangar and threatened to hit the streets if police forces were not withdrawn. ?police acted on the orders from the chief minister who herself had organised movements against land acquisition during the left regime. but now she is busy organising global business summits,? said cpi-m state secretariat member md salim.he criticised state minister and local mla moollah, who was the land reforms minister during the left regime, and said: ?bhangar?s uncrowned king was sitting silently while tension was building up.?echoing what the left leaders said during their rule, trinamool congress vice-president and rajya sabha mp mukul roy said: ?those creating disturbances are against development.??we are against land being taken away forcibly for any project,? said state congress president adhir chowdhury.","at least two people were killed while many were wounded after hundreds of villagers protesting against a power grid project clashed in west bengal's bhangar on tuesday, reports said. the victims died of bullet injuries, but villagers said police did not fire at them and alleged the involvement of supporters of the ruling tmc, reports added."
"the fifa president, gianni infantino, has robustly defended the decision to expand the world cup from    competing national teams to   , which will begin with the      tournament, in the face of immediate criticism from top european clubs. at a meeting in zurich, fifa?s rule-making council unanimously passed the new format, which will create a first round of    groups, from which two of three teams will qualify and proceed to a knockout competition beginning with    countries.fifa has projected that the increase to    countries will generate around $ bn more income, and $   m profit, from greater television rights and sponsorship. infantino said the money will be reinvested in football; he has promised all fifa?s     member countries? associations $ m a year to aid development.speaking after the meeting, infantino argued that the expanded tournament will increase interest in football worldwide by involving more countries, while not burdening players with more matches.responding robustly to criticism from the german football association (dfb) and european club association (eca), which derided fifa?s decision as having been taken for ?political reasons rather than sporting ones,? infantino said: ?we are in the   st century, and we should shape the world cup for the   st century. football is more than europe and south america; football is global.?fifa?s football associations, particularly in africa and asia, have historically been in favour of the tournament?s expansion, which infantino said will give them all more places in the finals. precise numbers are yet to be decided, as are some of the format?s details, including whether drawn first-round group matches could all be decided on penalties. the host for the      tournament is due to be considered in     , with a bid featuring the us, either on its own or in conjunction with one or both of canada and mexico, the overwhelming favourite.arguing that qualification for the world cup provides a key boost to football development in smaller countries, infantino pointed to the advances of iceland, wales and hungary in last year?s european championship as examples of ?beautiful stories?. european football?s governing body, uefa, decided in      to expand its tournament from    countries to   , and europe?s representatives on fifa?s council supported the world cup increase, despite the opposition from leading clubs.in a statement the eca, which has     member clubs in    european countries, said that the    team format is ?a perfect formula? and suggested that infantino had in mind electoral support from fifa?s member associations, which each vote for for the president. questioning the ?urgency? with which so historic a decision was taken, less than a year since infantino was elected, the eca said ?stakeholders? who will be ?impacted? had not been properly involved.?we understand that this decision has been taken based on political reasons rather than sporting ones and under considerable political pressure, something eca believes is regrettable,? the statement said.infantino declined to respond to reports immediately after fifa?s announcement that the spanish football league, la liga, which claimed it was not consulted at all, is considering a lawsuit. last week the dfb president, reinhard grindel, expressed ?immense reservations? about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing    more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.referring to his election last february on a proposal to expand the world cup to    teams, infantino said the prime objection from european clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournament?s length. he said fifa administrators had since examined four different formats and found that the   -team expansion could address those concerns.the immediate move to a   -team knockout competition after the two matches played by each country in the first round of    groups, means the finalists will have played seven games, the same as in the current format. the tournament can still be played over    days, as it is now. infantino pointed out that uefa?s expansion lengthened the european championship by a week, and incorporated one more match for the finalists.arguing that the quality of football is improving around the world, and pointing to the elimination of both england and italy by costa rica in the last world cup in     , infantino said: ?increasing the size of teams which can participate will increase the investment in football development, to make sure that the teams can qualify.?the fa?s chief executive, martin glenn, had said his preference was ?to keep the tournament smaller,? but he acknowledged that ?smaller countries understandably want to be part of the tournament.? the english representative on the fifa council, david gill, did not attend the meeting because of a previously arranged visit to australia, but given the strength of support for the expansion, he had been expected to vote in favour.in a statement after the decision, the fa said: ?we will work with uefa, fifa and the other european associations to understand how the   -team fifa world cup will work. the priority has to be consideration of the potential impact on fans, players, teams and leagues, and also recognition of the importance of sporting integrity and commercial viability.?","fifa on tuesday announced that penalty shootouts will be used to decide drawn matches between teams in the group stages of the fifa world cup, which shall feature    teams from the      edition onwards. the move is aimed at minimising the risk of teams colluding in their final group games to eliminate others from the tournament."

oh, what am i like!this is what stands in front of marin cilic today: federer the player and federer the legend. he isn?t supposed to win. it?s not that the seventh seed isn?t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated swiss coronation. it?s just that he isn?t roger. nor is the former us open champion much of a character, a card. he?s just a guy who?s good at tennis. unlike goran ivanisevic, the last croatian man to win wimbledon, there?s no good marin, bad marin and emergency marin. there?s just marin. it might not be enough to win their affections.it could be enough to win this final, though. cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed federer on the way to winning the us open in     . at his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. if the   -year-old doesn?t freeze, he could do something here. he was two sets up against federer in their quarter-final last year. underestimate him at your peril. but for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn?t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. and last year he had that knee injury. this time he?s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he?s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. it?s brought him another australian open title, his   th major, and titles in miami and indian wells. it could bring him an historic eighth wimbledon title.this is cilic?s second grand slam final. it?s federer?s   th here and his   th overall. he?s    in less than a month. this isn?t normal. but he isn?t normal. you wonder when it?s going to end. is it going to end? you know what they want on centre court. more roger. they can?t get enough roger. and do you know? it?s because there?s nothing else quite like it.play begins at:  pm bst.updated  at   .  pm bst  ","swiss tennis star roger federer won a record  th wimbledon men's singles title on sunday, while also becoming the oldest male player to win the championships in open era. the world number five defeated croatia's marin cilic  - ,  - ,  - , to lift a record   th grand slam title. notably, federer won the title without losing a set throughout the tournament."

"modern diesel cars produce    times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new european data has revealed.the stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (nox) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the eu, according to the researchers behind a new report. they say the same strict measures must be applied to cars.nox pollution is responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths across europe, with the uk suffering a particularly high toll. much of the pollution is produced by diesel cars, which on the road emit about six times more than allowed in the official lab-based tests. following the volkswagen ?dieselgate? scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.the new report from the international council on clean transportation (icct), a research group that played a key role in exposing volkswagen?s cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.it found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in germany and finland emitted about    mg nox per kilometre driven, less than half the    mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest ?euro  ? standard. however, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce    times more nox per litre of fuel.the icct analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.official eu tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles. ?in contrast, for measurement of nox emissions from trucks and buses, mobile testing devices became mandatory in     . as a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,? said peter mock, managing director of icct in europe.changes to the car testing regime in the eu are due to start in september, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (pems), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads. but mock warned: ?manufacturers will still be allowed to carefully select special prototype cars for emissions testing. instead, it would be much better to measure the emissions of ordinary mass-production vehicles, obtained from customers who have had been driving them in an ordinary way.? such a system is used in the us where the dieselgate scandal first emerged. it will also be put forward for discussion by the european commission on    january in brussels, but the icct said it faces resistance from some vehicle manufacturers and eu member states.in december, the european commission started legal action against the uk and six other eu states for failing to act against car emissions cheating in the wake of the dieselgate scandal. but later the same month, a draft european parliament inquiry found the european commission itself guilty of maladministration for failing to act quickly enough on evidence that defeat devices were being used to game emissions tests.evidence that some diesel cars emitted up to four times more nox pollution than a bus was revealed in     . catherine bearder, a liberal democrat mep and a lead negotiator on the eu?s air quality law, said ?it is disgraceful that car manufacturers have failed to reduce deadly emissions when the technology to do so is affordable and readily available. the dramatic reduction in nox emissions from heavier vehicles is a result of far stricter eu tests, in place since     , that reflect real-world driving conditions. if buses and trucks can comply with these limits, there?s no reason cars can?t as well.?? the headline on this article was amended on    january      to more precisely reflect the details of the article.","according to a recent european study, diesel cars are    times more toxic than diesel trucks and buses due to stricter european union testing standards applied to larger vehicles. nitrogen oxide emissions per kilometre for diesel cars were found to be double that of heavy-duty vehicles. diesel cars emit about six times more toxic gases than allowed, the study claimed."
"the theme for this year?s international women?s day was ?be bold for change? in the fight for a ?more gender inclusive world? ? but some at tesla had a different plan for the day. it was an opportunity for women to discover essential oils. a ?health and wellness group? at the electric car company invited female staff members to an   march ?lunch ?n learn? about oils and how they can help improve people?s ?health and happiness?, according to emails seen by the guardian, which reveal that the proposed event was quickly met with vocal criticism. it was particularly offensive to some given that a week earlier, aj vandermeyden, a female engineer, had publicly accused elon musk?s company of sexual harassment and discrimination.tesla postponed the oils session. the company organized a town hall meeting on diversity for that day, which included six male executives and one woman, according to multiple attendees. at the crowded meeting at the fremont factory, women took the microphone one-by-one and shared stories of sexual harassment, mistreatment by male managers, unfair promotion decisions and more, sources said.vandermeyden, who attended the meeting, thought the outpouring of comments validated her own story. but soon after, tesla fired her, accusing her of pursuing a ?miscarriage of justice? by filing a lawsuit that alleged ?pervasive harassment? and pay discrimination. testimony from the town hall ? along with internal emails from musk, and vandermeyden?s first interview since her termination ? paint a picture of a company that has struggled to respond to mounting complaints about gender discrimination and has aggressively attempted to discredit a woman who publicly criticized it .?they just want to absolutely crush anyone who speaks up,? said vandermeyden,   , seated inside her attorney?s san francisco office on a recent afternoon. ?i spoke up, and i was made a sacrificial lamb for it. it?s a scary precedent.?vandermeyden detailed the painful experience of losing a job she loved while facing harsh personal attacks by tesla in the media. she has come forward at a time when the tech industry is grappling with high profile sexual misconduct scandals at uber, a prominent venture capital firm and a popular startup incubator.tesla, known internationally for its battery-powered vehicles and self-driving car technology, has strongly rejected vandermeyden?s claims, saying she was terminated for ?falsely attacking our company in the press?. but the flurry of criticisms that emerged at the town hall suggests that her complaints are not unique.musk was not at the meeting, which was attended by roughly   -    people, and featured comments from more than    women, according to vandermeyden and another attendee. one woman described parts of the factory as a ?predator zone? for harassment. when the moderator asked women in the room if they had ever been catcalled, a significant number of women raised their hands, according to vandermeyden.other women allegedly talked about feeling unsafe around male managers and facing sexist remarks from superiors. women talked about being dismissed and talked over in meetings with no other female employees, and asked questions about diversity in hiring and the lack of women in leadership positions.some of the executives seemed genuinely concerned and taken aback by the women?s comments. one male leader said it was unacceptable, noting that he had daughters, said vandermeyden.one female manager, who was present but no longer works for tesla, told the guardian she was offended by that comment: ?it?s insulting. you shouldn?t have to have daughters to know this.? she said executives? responses to questions about diversity were generic and filled with corporate jargon.tesla said in an email that a women in tesla group hosted the event and that ?executives attended because they wanted to hear directly from employees about their experiences and learn about how to improve the workplace?. the company disputed the guardian?s characterization of the meeting, saying: ?employees stood up to ask the executives questions, share their experiences at tesla ? both positive and negative ? while others spoke of things that they believed tesla was doing right and some came with suggestions. in some instances, employees were only looking for better collaboration with their hr business partners in general and had nothing to do with any allegations of harassment.?the company statement said that when an employee referenced an area of the factory as a ?predator zone?, it ?surprised many in the room who had never heard of this term?. immediately after the meeting, tesla said it sent a factory-wide message to supervisors about its ?strict policy against any kind of harassment?, adding, ?any complaints of catcalling in the factory are thoroughly investigated and action is taken where necessary.?tesla also said that at the meeting, ?there was a lot of energy around ensuring we are proactively sourcing diverse talent and ensuring that we have an interview and assessment process that is free from bias?.vandermeyden said she talked briefly about her experience at the meeting, adding: ?it was finally giving women a venue to voice what was going on. it felt like tesla had been saying i?m making all this up. and here were all the women saying, ?no, it?s happening.? it?s too big to deny.?her lawsuit, filed last year, alleged that after she was hired in     , she was promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in a department that consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly assumed. men were also granted positions over her, and she and other women were denied promotions despite their equal or superior qualifications, the complaint said. she also said that tesla retaliated against her after she raised concerns about sexual harassment and catcalls she routinely faced on the factory floor. vandermeyden went public with her story in an interview with the guardian in february, prompting tesla to vehemently deny her allegations, claiming that an internal investigation concluded that there was no harassment, discrimination or retaliation.on    may, tesla announced the hiring of gaby toledano as the new chief people officer to oversee hr amid growing concerns about unsafe working conditions at the factory. toledano joined as the only woman in the ?c-suite?, meaning group of chief executives.one of her first major acts was to fire vandermeyden. i?m the one who spoke up, and they?re saying, ?one way or another, you have to leave.? how is that right?toledano asked vandermeyden to meet for coffee one-on-one without lawyers on    may, the memorial day holiday. vandermeyden said she thought it was an opportunity to discuss ways to improve the workplace and address her concerns, but instead she was told she could resign and get a severance package or she would be terminated immediately and should not show up for work the next day.?it felt like they were trying to intimidate me. i?m the one who spoke up, and they?re saying, ?one way or another, you have to leave.? how is that right?? vandermeyden recalled in the recent interview. toledano?s message to her was clear, she added: ??you can end this now or this is going to be litigation going on for years.??she refused to resign and was fired, she said. she has yet to return to tesla to clean out her desk.tesla disputed vandermeyden?s account of the meeting, saying: ?gaby did not intimidate ms vandermeyden. she disagrees that there was any intimidation, nor did ms vandermeyden ever express feeling intimidated during the meeting. in fact, they both had a positive rapport and expressed mutual support, as gaby was new to her role at tesla and was attempting to resolve the matter in a positive and mutually supportive manner for the company and for ms vandermeyden.?vandermeyden struggled to process the news and was further shocked when tesla released a    -word statement to the guardian justifying the termination. ?vandermeyden was given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications, and that negatively impacted other more qualified individuals,? the statement said, saying that she behaved in a ?fundamentally false and misleading manner?. the company said she ?falsely attacked? tesla in the press, amounting to a ?miscarriage of justice?, adding: ?it is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner.?her lawyer, therese lawless, well known for fighting discrimination in silicon valley, said the statement was clear evidence that tesla?s termination was retaliation for raising concerns about workplace conditions, which is her legally protected right.in addition to saying she was not qualified for her job, tesla has also repeatedly noted that vandermeyden did not have an engineering degree, a fact many tech journalists have repeated in articles. but according to vandermeyden and another tesla employee, this is not uncommon; she said she knew of at least two male engineers in her department without a degree.  musk also appeared to reference vandermeyden in a company-wide email sent two days after her termination. in the email ? with the subject ?doing the right thing?, sent at  .  am ? musk lamented the scrutiny that his company faces, saying, ?the list of companies that want to kill tesla is so long, i?ve lost track.?as as a result, he continued, employees must work harder and faster than competitors, adding they can?t be a ?jerk? in the process.musk did not name vandermeyden, but went on to offer what seemed to be a thinly veiled attack on her lawsuit: ?if you are part of a less represented group, you don?t get a free pass on being a jerk yourself. we have had a few cases at tesla where someone in a less represented group was actually given a job or promoted over more qualified highly represented candidates and then decided to sue tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren?t promoted enough. that is obviously not cool.? vandermeyden, who had not seen the email until the guardian provided it to her, said it was painful to read: ?it?s saying everything i?ve done at tesla, all the hard work, it?s dismissing it all. it hurts because there are going to be some people who believe that.?she also noted that she has consistently received positive performance evaluations and called his email ?defamatory?.asked about the email, tesla said in a statement: ?this email in fact did not reference ms vandermeyden or her case.?vandermeyden said she wished that musk would consider that ?dissent isn?t disloyalty? and that her love of tesla drove her to advocate for better working conditions. ?i was never your enemy,? she said, adding: ?i still believe in the importance of transitioning the world to sustainable energy, but now i don?t get to be a part of it.?she recalled getting a t-shirt with musk as a superhero when she first joined tesla, and that it was hard to realize that ?sometimes your superheroes aren?t always super?.","according to a report by the guardian, several female employees at tesla have complained about sexual harassment, mistreatment by male managers, and unfair promotion decisions at a recent town hall meeting. one woman described tesla's factory as a ""predator zone"" for harassment. in june, tesla fired a female engineer who accused the automaker of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment."

"scientists have modified human embryos to remove genetic mutations that cause heart failure in otherwise healthy young people in a landmark demonstration of the controversial procedure.it is the first time that human embryos have had their genomes edited outside china, where researchers have performed a handful of small studies to see whether the approach could prevent inherited diseases from being passed on from one generation to the next.while none of the research so far has created babies from modified embryos, a move that would be illegal in many countries, the work represents a milestone in scientists? efforts to master the technique and brings the prospect of human clinical trials one step closer.the work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer.?this embryo gene correction method, if proven safe, can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations,? said paula amato, a fertility specialist involved in the us-korean study at oregon health and science university.the scientists used a powerful gene editing tool called crispr-cas  to fix mutations in embryos made with the sperm of a man who inherited a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or hcm. the disease, which leads to a thickening of the heart?s muscular wall, affects one in     people and is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people.crispr, or to give it its full name, crispr-cas , allows scientists to precisely target and edit pieces of the genome. crispr is a guide molecule made of rna, that allows a specific site of interest on the dna double helix to be targeted. the rna molecule is attached to cas , a bacterial enzyme that works as a pair of ""molecular scissors"" to cut the dna at the exact point required. this allows scientists to cut, paste and delete single letters of genetic code. humans have two copies of every gene, but some diseases are caused by a mutation in only one of the copies. for the study, the scientists recruited a man who carried a single mutant copy of a gene called mybpc  which causes hcm.when the scientists made embryos with the man?s sperm and healthy eggs from donors, they found that, as expected, about half of the embryos carried the mutant gene. if the affected embryos were implanted into women and carried to term, the resulting children would inherit the heart condition.writing in the journal nature, the researchers describe how gene editing dramatically reduced the number of embryos that carried the dangerous mutation. when performed early enough, at the same time as fertilisation,    out of    embryos, or   %, were found to be free of the disease-causing mutation.the work has impressed other scientists in the field because in previous experiments, gene editing has worked only partially, mending harmful mutations in some cells, but not others. another problem happens when the wrong genes are modified by mistake, but in the latest work the scientists found no evidence of these so-called ?off target effects??they?ve got remarkably good results, it?s a big advance.? said richard hynes, a geneticist at mit who this year co-chaired a major report on human genome editing for the us national academy of sciences (nas). ?this brings it closer to clinic, but there?s still a lot of work to do.?today, people who carry certain genetic diseases can opt for ivf and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. the procedure can only help if there is a chance that some embryos will be healthy. according to shoukhrat mitalipov, who led the latest research, gene editing could bolster the number of healthy embryos available for doctors to implant.more work is needed to prove that gene editing would be safe to do in people, but even if it seems safe, scientists face major regulatory hurdles before clinical trials could start. in the us, congress has barred the food and drug administration from even considering human trials with edited embryos, while in the uk it is illegal to implant genetically modified embryos in women. the procedure is controversial because genetic modifications made to an embryo affect not only the child it becomes but future generations too. ?it?s still a long road ahead,? said mitalipov. ?it?s unclear when we?d be allowed to move on.?in the latest study, the mutation was corrected by a route that scientists have not seen before, with the cell copying healthy dna from the mother?s egg instead of the template. one question scientists need to explore now is whether mutations carried by eggs can be corrected as easily as those carried by sperm.?if all of this holds up for different genes and is also true when the mutation is inherited from the mother, it will be a major step forward,? said janet rossant, senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the hospital for sick children in toronto.asked about the potential for gene editing to produce designer babies, rossant, a co-author of the nas report on gene editing, said it was a distant prospect. ?we are still a long way from serious consideration of using gene editing to enhance traits in babies,? she said. ?we don?t understand the genetic basis of many of the human traits that might be targets for enhancement. even if we did, a genetic alteration that enhanced one trait could have unexpected negative consequences on other traits, and this would be an inherited feature for the next generation.??the nas report came out strongly against any form of gene editing designed to simply enhance human potential,? she added.","scientists, for the first time, successfully freed embryos of a piece of faulty dna that causes a fatal heart disease to run in families. the disease, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, causes the heart to stop suddenly and is the result of an error in a single gene. the breakthrough could lead to preventing   ,    disorders that are passed down the generations."

"snapdeal is going through tough times. today we heard that the company cut     jobs and that there is a lot of confusion and chaos in its offices. also the company founders have taken a full, which means     per cent, salary cut. the gravity of the situation can be ascertained from the email that snapdeal founders have presumably written to the company employees. it has been leaked and posted on pastebin so far now we are not completely sure that this is the complete and genuine email. but it sure seems to have come from the founders. here is the full text:--at snapdeal, we find ourselves at an important point in our journey - we know where we want to go and now is the time to make the choices of how we will get there.has our company and industry been going through a troubled time? absolutely. did we make errors in our execution? no doubt about that. over the last  -  years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. we started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out. we also started diversifying and starting new projects while we still hadn't perfected the first or made it profitable. we started building our team and capabilities for a much larger size of business than what was required with the present scale.ambition is critical, because that's what motivates us to give our very best every single day - to achieve the undoable. however, a large amount of capital with ambition can be a potent mix that drives a company to defocus from its core. we feel that happened to us. we started doing too many things, and all of us starting with myself and rohit, are to blame for it.that said, there is almost no successful company on the planet, which hasn't gone through this phase in their lifetime - apple, amazon, netflix, tesla, lego, spicejet, you name it! each one of them had painted themselves into a corner many times over before they became as wildly successful as they are today. a quick look at their stock prices over the last    years will show you what we're talking about. the formula to revive the company is uncannily similar for almost all of them - focus on only your core, stop all non-core activities, reduce costs drastically, turn profitable as soon as you can, and use those profits to spur further growth and new projects. we must do the same, and there is no doubt that with the really smart folks we have in the company, we will make it something that we are all very proud of.this also comes with some tough decisions in the short term. as part of our overall path to profitability plan that is currently in full swing, we will be reorganizing the company into a lean, focused, and entrepreneurial one. we are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. sadly, we will also be saying really painful goodbyes to some of our colleagues in this process. this is by far the hardest decision that we have ever taken in our lives. our colleagues are our friends before they are co-workers, and i feel a deep sense of disappointment that we won't be able to have them continue on this journey with us. we will do what we can to help them with their transition to their next opportunity. we take this time to express our sincere gratitude to all those who are leaving us -your contributions have helped build snapdeal in ways big and small. with time, i am confident, that we will be able to welcome back some of our colleagues who will be leaving us at this point. and that point, we will be a self sufficient, profitable company.daunting as it may appear in the moment, it is important that we do this now, so that we can continue on our overall mission of building a successful, profitable business that provides incredible opportunities to our customers, sellers and partners. this also means more responsibility for the team members continuing on this journey with us.we believe that every resource of the company should be deployed for driving us towards profitable growth and with this announcement, both rohit and i are taking a    % salary cut. many of our leaders have also stepped up proactively and offered to take a significant cut in their compensation, which is an excellent sign of how galvanised the team feels in this shared quest for profitability.these are tough times, no doubt. but, i am supremely confident, that like we have done before as a team, we will prevail. the greatest companies in the world got built in many interesting patterns - we just can't tell the pattern while are in the midst of it. for now, we need to keep our heads down, focus all our energy on execution that delivers on our two focus areas - best customer and seller experience, and profitable growth. this will mean tough choices and a conscious departure from a me-too race to the edge of the cliff. let's remember - gmv is vanity, profit is sanity.i have seen that whenever we put our minds to a well-defined plan, which we believe in unequivocally, we make progress like nobody else can. i am glad that we have picked our path clearly - of building a profitable business over the next two years.","the snapdeal founders have written an email to employees explaining the layoffs of around     people. ""did we make errors in our execution? no doubt about that. over the last  -  years, with all the capital coming..., our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes.""

to taunt the congress, naqvi said the people of gujarat have been ?deeply hurt by this conspiracy? and the congress should apologise to them. he also claimed that the gujarat elections will be held in a fair and free atmosphere.the congress members trooped into the well raising slogans like ?stop murder of democracy?.in a bid to run the house, deputy chairman p j kurien asked the congress members whether they wanted to apologise for ?what you said in the morning?. however, he did not get any response from them.kurien also asked the ruling party members to help in running the house.irked at not getting any response from either side, kurien repeatedly warned that he would be forced to adjourn the house. ?both sides are not cooperating. both sides are shouting. they are creating problems...i will have to adjourn the house. this is the time for private members? business and if the members do not cooperate, i will be forced to adjourn.??i am helpless,? the deputy chairman said before adjourning the house for the day.congress members had earlier repeatedly trooped into the well raising anti-government slogans and charging the bjp with ?stealing? mlas to help its candidates win the rajya sabha polls, forcing brief adjournments one after the other.the house was adjourned twice during zero hour after it had assembled for the day and then twice again during the question hour till  .   pm.soon after the house assembled, kurien first adjourned the proceedings for    minutes as congress leaders, including leader of opposition ghulam nabi azad and congress? deputy leader anand sharma, raised the issue and the party members stormed the well raising slogans.similar scenes were witnessed when the house met again, forcing kurien to adjourn the proceedings till noon. a repeat of the protests saw chairman hamid ansari to adjourn the house for    minutes after it reassembled.as there was no let-up in the opposition protests, the house was again adjourned till      hours, with chairman ansari saying the deputy chairman has said that matters relating to elections are dealt by the concerned agencies.raising the issue, azad said three congress mlas who had resigned from the party and one of them was immediately named as the bjp candidate for the upcoming rajya sabha polls.he said punabhai gamit, mla from reserved constituency of vyara, after attending district congress executive committee, had gone for a cup of tea to another mla?s house when district superintendent of police ?abducted? him.azad alleged that the police officer told the mla that congress has decided not to give him a ticket for the upcoming assembly polls. so he should leave the party and join the bjp and he would arrange his meeting with the bjp president and get him the ticket, he claimed.he said the police officer who had picked up the congress mla was the one who was arrested in a fake encounter case. the legislator managed to flee when he asked the police officer to allow him to get a changeover of clothes, he claimed.?you are stealing mlas by using the police (to garner votes),? azad said, adding ?you should be ashamed.?the charge was vehemently denied by naqvi, saying ?this is wrong. the election commission is conducting free and fair elections.?earlier, sharma had raised the issue through a point of order saying the constitution was being violated by the ruling bjp which was using the police to ?abduct? mlas.?they are stealing mlas,? he said, adding that it must be guaranteed that the biennial elections to the rajya sabha are free and fair and the ?abducted? mlas released.union minister parshottam rupala also sought to counter the charge saying it was an internal matter of the congress whose mlas, including the leader of the party in the gujarat assembly, were deserting it.?why are you complaining here,? he said, adding ?you are not taking care of your own house and are accusing us. your own people are leaving you?.naqvi said it is the election commission?s responsibility to hold free and fair elections. ?if they have a complaint, they should go to election commission. rajya sabha is not the place to protest.??you have to protect the constitution ... voters are being kidnapped where do we go,? azad said.kurien said the chair has nothing to do with elections. ?if what has been narrated has happened, solution lies elsewhere. you can approach police, you can approach election commission and seek remedy. i have no remedy for this.?he asked protesting members to return to their seats but his pleas went unheeded. ?what is the use of obstructing,? he asked before adjourning the proceedings for    minutes.when the house reassembled, anand sharma again raised the issue of abduction. to this, kurein asked what could he do.azad suggested that the chair could give a direction to the election commission to ensure fair election. he said the officer involved in the incident should be removed.kurien, however, said the election commission ?does not require a direction from the chair? to conduct free and fair election, as it is bound to do so and ?they are doing it. ... if you have a complaint, approach election commission.?during the question hour, sitaram yechury (cpi-m) said incidents like abduction of an mla by a police officer was not acceptable and sought the chair?s protection to save democracy.naqvi also took pot-shots at the main opposition party, sarcastically saying they would now demand a direction to the surpreme court as several of their members were ?involved in corruption? cases.",rajya sabha proceedings were adjourned on friday after congress members reportedly created a disturbance to protest the alleged abduction of their mla by police in gujarat. they also accused bjp of 'stealing' mlas to influence the upcoming rajya sabha elections and forced repeated adjournments. union minister mukhtar abbas naqvi demanded congress' apology to gujarat for 'tarnishing its image'.

"in the wake of recent controversies where several filmmakers have locked horns with the central board of film certification (cbfc), a fresh debate has been triggered by filmmaker shyam benegal meeting with the officials at the information & broadcasting ministry. the filmmaker met the ministry officials to check the status of the report submitted by a special committee led by him in     , which suggested that cbfc should limit its functioning to issuing certificates to movies and not impose censoring.while benegal is hopeful that government will push the much required revamping of the cbfc and introduce changes in the archaic cinematograph act     , we contacted him to for clarity on any deadline given by the ministry. he tells us, ?we submitted the report in two parts?in april and october last years?and they are yet to take any action. i?ve been after them for the last    days but i can?t talk much because i have sworn to maintain the confidentiality of the subject until the ministry itself reacts.?he adds, ?i?d urge you to get in touch with the joint secretary or the secretary of the ministry or even the minister ms. smriti irani and ask them what happened to the report and why haven?t they taken any action on the proposed changes.?the committee has proposed amendments such as introducing a new category called ?adult with caution? and sub-dividing existing categories into ua   + and ua   + to make the content accessible to appropriate audience. if we don?t have a rating system in between ua and a, we will suggest cuts otherwise we can?t certify.reacting to the points mentioned in the report, pahlaj nihalani, cbfc chairman says, ?what the shyam benegal report says, i don?t agree with that because he?s not demanding the right things. if we don?t have a rating system in between ua and a, so definitely we will suggest them cuts otherwise we can?t certify [the film].?with an underlined sarcasm, nihalani adds, ?a wrong interpretation by some unknowledgeable people that cbfc is just a certification body, as along with that there?s an act and rulebook also, which you can?t forget.?while all this is still being debated upon, we asked film frat if it?s about time that censor board should be revamped and new changed be introduced.if certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor  what they?d like to consumestating that it?s ?pathetically regressive? to have an appointed board deciding on creative cuts, filmmaker homi adajania opines, ?it?s bizarre that some pseudo-intellectual diktat can be passed allowing a screen kiss to linger for six seconds but not eight! what happens in those two seconds? it?s all just so freaking backward.? he adds, ?if certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor what they?d like to consume, knowing what the film?s rating stands for and through this they will not be offended by the content.?director ruchi narain, whose animated film hanuman ?da damdaar faced censorship issues, quips, ?it?s the simple truth. government should govern. reporters should report. film makers should make films. certification board should certify. if you start censoring everything, you turn blank and have nothing to say.?ruling out any possibility that bollywood can ever be free from censorship, filmmaker hansal mehta says it?s sad that there?s no will to actually bring about a change. ?i heard about this draft for a bill being proposed, which will be studied by the cabinet. but when will it be tabled in the parliament? when will it actually go through?? asks mehta.we?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of cbfc?every time there a furor around a film, there?s some spoken gesture that comes through but there?s no action. i have this sinking feeling that we?ll have to live with censorship that has existed since cbfc came into existence and cinematograph act was formed in     . so, we?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of cbfc,? he adda.in support of shyam benegal committee report, film critic omar qureshi says, ?censorship rules and regulations are as archaic as it gets and these new recommendations are an upgradation on the lines of the american association that has pg   and pg   and ?approved for all audiences? as per guidelines set for movies depending upon language and adult and violence quotient. and in any case, the word ?censor? is wrong. the body was always meant to guide and certify. never censor. it reduces the freedom of expression to naught. words like censorship are used in non democratic countries. not in our great grey democracy.?follow @htshowbiz for more","filmmaker shyam benegal said the media should question information and broadcasting (i&b) minister smriti irani on what happened to the report submitted by the special committee, which he heads, for reforming the censor board. benegal added, ""why haven't they taken any action on the proposed changes?"" the report had suggested that board should not impose censoring but only certify movies."

""}}anees bazmee?s welcome is one of the most underrated comedies of recent times. however, over the years, it has become one of the most watched films on tv.in fact, its situational comedy is a lesson in comic timing and how to carry off a slapstick humour. this amazingly funny film revolves around an eligible bachelor who falls in love with a gangster?s sister, and how he creates confusion to have his way. since then, bazmee has directed singh is kinng, no problem, thank you, ready and welcome back. all these films had the theme of marriage at the centre.watch: our facebook live discussion on mubarakan, indu sarkar and raag deshbazmee?s latest mubarakan follows a similar trajectory, with a double-role angle. separated in childhood, twins, karan and charan (both played by arjun kapoor) are expected to marry as per their guardians? wishes, but they are already in love with sweety (ileana d?cruz) and nafisa (neha sharma).things get complicated when charan gets engaged to a another girl, binkal (athiya shetty) in london. the shy guy couldn?t gather the courage to tell his parents about his love life and that leads to a big-intra family feud that ends when charan?s uncle swears to marry him off in exactly one month.however, kartar singh (anil kapoor) is yet to arrive and add more confusion to the already-messed up affair.mubarakan is a typical bazmee film which starts with loud background music and solid bass. the hero walks in slow motion and dances to peppy tunes, but shows a docile attitude in front of the heroine. arjun kapoor takes a cue from akshay kumar in welcome and jumps into this mad-caper wholeheartedly. it?s just that anil kapoor is a pro at it and steals all the limelight from him.his character drives a vehicle that has slogans like ?buri nazar wale tera muh gora? and ?you are chasing a punjabi? written all over it. he then employs an english man who mouths dialogues like ?baadshaho tussi lassi pio? and ?meri pagar padhao.? most of us don?t expect any sort of explanations from such a film, so it keeps moving from chandigarh to london in a jiffy with songs thrown in occasionally. they?re anyway needed to hold attention in this    -minute film.you also find dialogues like, ?ye zaroor druggie hai? ye punjab se aaya hai.? then somebody casually mentions, ?udta punjab,? and everybody starts laughing.anil kapoor, however, tries his best to hold the family and the story together. as someone who unknowingly keeps creating chaos, he has been rightly given a good screen time. the only actor who outperforms in a couple of scenes is pavan malhotra. as an always angry hotelier who hates to be seen down upon, he is hilarious.mubarakan shows some witty character sketches before losing its charm in the later half. the indecisive arjun kapoor and self-musing anil kapoor successfully establish a mood where you don?t mind dialogues like, ?iss baar christmas    ko hai?? or, ?ye mooli, maamooli nahi hai.? in fact, you laugh when somebody falls off a window while trying to find the mobile network. well, i did.unfortunately, such moments keep getting fewer in number in the second half as the film gets totally centred on anil kapoor and his antics. unlike welcome, he doesn?t get much support from his co-actors and gigs become repetitive in nature.some of priyadarshan?s most likeable comedies also deal with an army of actors and a confusing thread in the climax, but he doesn?t waste much time in clearing the confusion. bazmee takes time here as some of his characters go for long monologues. this slows down the pace and gives the audience a chance to realise the loopholes in the otherwise over-simplified story.mubarakan is designed as a family film where comedy is generated through quarrelling relatives. this works initially but goes out of control later.but that doesn?t mean you won?t be entertained. you?ll be occasionally laughing, but probably won?t be leaving the theatre with a big smile on your face.interact with rohit vats at twitter/@nawabjha","the arjun kapoor and anil kapoor starrer 'mubarakan' which released on friday ""shows some witty character sketches before losing its charm"", wrote hindustan times. ndtv wrote, ""the film goes overboard with its excessive cheeriness...into the realms of inanity"", while times of india called the film's three actresses ""decorative set-pieces"". it was rated  . /  (ht),  /  (ndtv) and  /  (toi)."

rating. the poll found that   % believed america?s leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office, while support for republican plans to replace barack obama?s affordable care act was at just   % compared with   % who support the former president?s signature healthcare policy. trump, who has spent the weekend at his private golf club in bedminster, new jersey, attempted to downplay the poll?s findings. on sunday morning he used twitter to claim, incorrectly, that ?almost   % [approval] is not bad at this time? and that the poll in question had been ?just about the most inaccurate around election time!?.in fact, the washington post/abc poll came close to predicting the popular vote on election day ? which hillary clinton won by  . m ballots, trump taking the white house in the electoral college ?

if this was nefarious ? why the secret service allowed these people in?? he told abc news. ?the president had secret service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.?a spokesman for the secret service later confirmed that trump jr was not under the agency?s protection at the time of the meeting and ?thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with?.under pressure from the new york times, trump jr this week released damning emails revealing he eagerly embraced what he was told was a russian government attempt to damage the clinton campaign.the emails show music promoter rob goldstone telling the future president?s son that ?the crown prosecutor of russia? had offered ?to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father?.the new york times reported that trump signed off on his son?s first statement to the times about the meeting, which like subsequent statements was soon revealed not to be a full account of events.kushner, trump?s senior adviser, and then campaign manager paul manafort also attended the meeting. it was revealed on friday that rinat akhmetshin, a russian american lobbyist and former soviet military officer, was present as well.earlier on sunday morning, trump tweeted more outspoken support for his eldest son.?hillary clinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete   ,    emails but my son don is being scorned by the fake news media?? the president wrote.trump has previously described the political storm over his son?s meeting as ?the greatest witch-hunt in political history? and ?sad!? and said anyone would have taken the meeting as offered.speaking to reporters on air force one on thursday, the president said   -year-old trump jr was ?a good boy? and added: ?and he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting. it was a short meeting, as he told me ? because i only heard about it two or three days ago.?the trump campaign committee?s finance filing also shows it paid $  ,    to the trump corporation, which is led by trump jr and his brother, eric, for ?legal consulting?.it was announced on saturday that trump had hired washington attorney ty cobb to serve as his special counsel regarding the russia investigations being run by the senate judiciary and intelligence committees and special counsel robert mueller, a former fbi director appointed after trump fired his successor james comey in may.the move seemingly reflects the president?s growing acceptance that the investigations will linger over his tenure for months or even years.on sunday morning, he also tweeted: ?thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the women?s us open. very cool!?the golfing event trump referred to took place at his club where, according to reports, members pay up to $   ,    in joining fees.

"the supreme court ordered on friday a federal investigation into    alleged extra-judicial killings in    years by security forces in manipur, overruling objections by the government and the army in a landmark decision hailed by human rights activists.a bench headed by justice mb lokur ordered the central bureau of investigation (cbi) to set up a team for the probe and asked the agency?s director to respond within two weeks. the    cases were between      and     .the army ? which is accused in at least    cases ? wanted an internal probe.the court gave the cbi time till by december    to lodge cases, complete its investigation and file charge-sheets before an appropriate forum.?these petitions should be listed positively in the second week of january,     , to ensure compliance with our directions for investigation by the cbi,? the bench said.in july last year, the top court had ruled that all incidents involving suspected use of excessive and retaliatory force by the army in manipur must be investigated. the decision had come on a petition that alleged  ,    staged shootings by the army and other security forces during     -   in manipur.?the army and paramilitary personnel ?cannot use excessive or retaliatory force? even in areas where the armed forces (special powers) act,      (afspa) had been notified,? the order had said.manipur police officers will not be included in the special probe team as the state force?s role in the killings has also come under the scanner. the police, the court said, hadn?t registered cases despite complaints by families of victims.the order is a setback for the army. former attorney general mukul rohatgi, who was defending the military in court until he retired this year, had argued against reopening the cases for investigation.but the top court rejected rohatgi?s argument, saying ?death of a person, possibly innocent, cannot be overlooked only because of lapse of time?.the state has an obligation to conduct a thorough inquiry at an appropriate time. however, it cannot take advantage of the delay to scuttle an inquiry, the court said.?our constitutional jurisprudence does not permit us to shut the door on such persons and our constitutional obligation requires us to give justice and succour to the next of kin of the deceased,? it added.the court also dismissed the centre?s argument that the affected families were compensated.?this cannot override the law of the land, otherwise all heinous crimes would get settled through payment of monetary compensation,? the bench said.it asked the government not to reduce the national human rights commission into a ?toothless tiger? but obey the panel?s suggestions.?the respect and dignity of the dead and the human rights of all of us will remain only on paper? unless the commission?s guidelines are followed, the bench said.human rights activists in manipur welcomed the top court?s directive but also sounded a note of caution about the composition of the investigating team.?it is too early to celebrate,? said babloo loitongbam of the human rights alert that along with an association of families filed a petition in the supreme court in      on the extra-judicial killings.advocate and human rights activist rakesh meihoubam recalled the case of   -year-old azad khan, allegedly shot dead in front of his parents and villagers, and a handgun planted at the site to label him a militant. an infuriated judge had reportedly asked how a   -year-old student could be a militant, he added.(with agency inputs)","the supreme court on friday ordered the cbi to set up special teams to investigate into    alleged encounters by the indian army and other security forces in manipur. asking the agency to respond within two weeks, the sc has overruled objections by the government and the army, which is accused in    of the    cases, with this order."

 to dismiss pakistan's claim. the decision was announced by bench president gilbert guillaume of france at a public sitting. the verdict was final and there was no appeal.the icj found that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by pakistan on september   ,     .public hearings in the case titled 'aerial incident of august   ,      (pakistan vs india)' lasted four days ending april  ,     . arguments centred on the court's jurisdiction in the case which had to be determined before its merits could be considered by the    judges.more about the atlantique casethe atlantique case was ousted by the icj on the issue of jurisdiction and not on merits. both parties had agreed that the question of jurisdiction would be decided first and only then would the issue of merits be taken up.guillaume said the court would first have to decide whether it had the jurisdiction to go into the case as contended by new delhi after the indian delegation led by the then attorney general soli sorabjee, raised preliminary objections to its jurisdiction.pakistan opened the first round of oral arguments, india replying them, and then pakistan following with its second round, with india making its response thereto.india's argumentsindia argued that the court did not have jurisdiction in the matter, citing an exemption it had filed way back in      to exclude disputes between india and other commonwealth states, and disputes covered by multilateral treaties.sorabjee told the court that pakistan was 'solely responsible' for the incident and islamabad must 'bear the consequences of its own acts.'pakistan's attorney general aziz munshi had sought a speedy resolution, saying its application had to be concluded quickly so that it did not remain an irritant in indo-pak relations.pakistan had also sought to politicise the case by referring to the kashmir issue, the kargil conflict, indo-pak relations and alleged motives for the shooting.pakistan's argumentspakistan wanted the court to intervene while india was opposed to its assumption of jurisdiction on the basis of islamabad's application.it urged the court to ""dismiss the objections raised by india and accept its jurisdiction."" india maintained that none of pakistan's arguments is 'sound' and does not provide a basis for invoking the court's jurisdiction.sorabjee expressed happiness with the court's verdict.""we are very happy. the court has accepted all our contentions,"" he had said.former supreme court judge b p jeevan reddy and pakistan's former attorney general syed sharifuddin pirzada were co-opted into the bench as ad-hoc judges.icj rules on judgesas per icj rules, when it does not include a judge possessing the nationality of the state party to a case, the state may appoint a person to sit as a judge ad-hoc for the purpose of the case.the court also recalled that its lack of jurisdiction does not relieve states of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means.the choice of those means admittedly rests with the parties under article    of the un charter, it said, adding, they are nonetheless under an obligation to seek such a settlement, and to do so in good faith in accordance with the charter.as regards india and pakistan, that obligation was restated more particularly in the simla accord of july  ,     . moreover, the lahore declaration of    february,      reiterated ""the determination of both countries to implementing the simla agreement,"" it said.settle disputes by peaceful meansaccordingly, the court reminded the parties of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means, and in particular the dispute arising out of the atlantique incident in conformity with the obligations which they have undertaken.india's external affairs ministry while hailing the verdict especially welcomed the court's positive observations on the principles enunciated in the simla agreement and lahore declaration as the basis for an indo-pak rapprochement.through its comments, the court has vindicated india's stand on these landmark agreements that are the very cornerstone of india-pakistan relations, a ministry spokesman had said.also read:kulbhushan jadhav death sentence: pakistan to overrule international court of justice's order","before the hearing on the death sentence awarded to kulbhushan jadhav, the last time india and pakistan faced off at the international court of justice was nearly    years ago. islamabad had sought the court's intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft by the indian air force in     . a   -judge bench voted   -

"over    retired ias and ips officers have written an open letter to the narendra modi government asking it to enforce the rule of law and not allow vigilantism to grow. the open letter has been signed by    officers including noted former bureaucrats bhaskar ghose, harsh mandar and wajahat habibullah. the former administrators are particularly unhappy with the way self-appointed cow vigilantes are going around, attacking and lynching people in the name of protecting the animal. majority of such attacks in recent past have had communal overtones.they ex-bureaucrats said, ""gau-rakshaks function with impunity and seem to be doing so with the tacit complicity or active encouragement of state machinery.""the letter was written on june   . however, prime minister narendra modi has expressed his 'anger' against cow vigilantism since then at public meeting in gujarat.speaking at sabaramati ashram on thursday, prime minister modi warned those ""taking law in their hands in the name of protection of cows."" 'intolerance everywhere'they also expressed deep concern over growing intolerance in the universities across the country. they said, ""student groups and faculty members on campuses like hyderabad and jnu, who raise troubling questions about equality, social justice and freedom, are subject to attack by the administration, with a supportive government to back them.""the retired top officials are also critical of the centre's action against the ngos for violating foreign contribution laws. ""several reputed ngos and civil society organisations are being charged with violating the provisions of the foreign contribution (regulation) act and the income tax act,"" they said. they further said, ""while we agree that genuine violators should be identified we note with dismay that several of the targeted groups are those who have taken stands against government policies, expressed dissent or supported communities in cases against the state.""""there is a growing hyper-nationalism that reduces any critique to a binary: if you are not with the government, you are anti-national,"" the retired ias and ips officers said, adding, ""these actions undermine the rule of law and the indian constitution since only the state - through its various organs and institutions - has the power to enforce the law.""following is the full text:open letter by retired officials on the growing religious intolerancesaturday    june     the following is an open letter of sixtyfive retired officials released on june   ,     .we are a group of retired officers of all india and central services of different batches, who have worked with the central and state governments in the course of our careers. we should make it clear that as a group, we have no affiliation with any political party but believe in the credo of impartiality, neutrality and commitment to the indian constitution. a sense of deep disquiet at what has been happening in india has prompted us to write this open letter to chronicle our reservations and misgivings about recent developments in the body politic. what has gone wrong?it appears as if there is a growing climate of religious intolerance that is aimed primarily at muslims. in uttar pradesh, in the run-up to the elections, an odious and frankly communal comparison was made between the relative number of burial grounds and cremation grounds. the question was also asked as to whether electricity was being supplied equally to different communities during their religious festivals. all this without any basis in fact or evidence. the banning of slaughter-houses targets the minorities and affects their livelihoods as well. such intolerance breeds violence in a communally charged atmosphere-even to the extent of a local leader in up provoking an attack upon the residence of a superintendent of police, whose family was terrorised.vigilantism has become widespread. an akhlaq is killed on the basis of a suspicion that the meat he has is beef and a pehlu khan is lynched while transporting to his place two cows he had bought and for which he had the necessary papers. nomadic shepherds are attacked in jammu and kashmir on some suspicion as they practice their age-old occu-pation of moving from one place to another along with their cattle and belongings. punitive action against the perpetrators of violence does not take place promptly but cruelly, the victims have firs registered against them. the behaviour of vigilantes-who act as if they are prosecutor, judge and executioner rolled into one-flies in the face of law and juris-prudence. these actions undermine the rule of law and the indian constitution since only the state-through its various organs and insti-tutions-has the power to enforce the law.vigilantism has become popular as 'anti-romeo' squads threaten young couples who go out together, hold hands and are perhaps in love with each other. a thinly-veiled effort to prevent a hindu-muslim relationship or marriage, there is no justification in law to harass these couples, particularly when there is no complaint from the woman of being ill-treated.student groups and faculty members on campuses like hyderabad and jnu, who raise troubling questions about equality, social justice and freedom, are subject to attack by the administration, with a supportive government to back them. in jodhpur, a planned lecture by a renowned academic was cancelled under pressure and the faculty that organised the event subjected to disciplinary action. what happened in jodhpur has happened at other institutions as well. argumentation and discussion about different perspectives-the life-blood not only of institutions of learning but of democracy itself-are being throttled. disagree-ment and dissent are considered seditious and anti-national. such attitudes have a chilling impact on free speech and thought.several reputed ngos and civil society organisations are being charged with violating the provisions of the foreign contribution (regulation) act and the income tax act. while we agree that genuine violators should be identified and penalised, we note with dismay that several of the targeted groups are those who have taken stands against government policies, expressed dissent or supported communities in cases against the state.we are also seeing an ugly trend of trolling, threats and online intimidation of activists, journalists, writers and intellectuals who disagree with the dominant ideology. how does this square with free speech?there is a growing hyper-nationalism that reduces any critique to a binary: if you are not with the government, you are anti-national. those in authority should not be questioned- that is the clear message.in the face of a rising authoritarianism and majoritarianism, which do not allow for reasoned debate, discussion and dissent, we appeal to all public authorities, public institutions and constitutional bodies to take heed of these disturbing trends and take corrective action. we have to reclaim and defend the spirit of the constitution of india, as envisaged by the founding fathers.(inputs from seemi pasha in new delhi) also read| story of lynching: kashmir to haryana, how hate crime thrives in absence of lawsrinagar: dsp ayyub pandith beaten to death by mob

"neck-deep in legal trouble, a mining baron from bellary from karnataka has finally decided to knock on the doors of the ?judge uncle? in neighbouring kerala?s kottayam district.the judge in this case is the presiding deity of a small shrine located at the corner of the cheruvally sree devi temple of kottayam with an ever growing reputation of helping people wriggle out of legal mess. the belief is judge ammavan (uncle) does not disappoint and the mining baron mired in legal cases has made the trip to the temple to make a special offering.those who throng the temple are controversial figures and to give them anonymity, the shrine opens just for    minutes and that too only in the night, after the main cheruvally temple closes after evening prayers.visitors at the temple are the veritable who?s who of south india: malayalam actor dileep is in jail for his alleged involvement in the abduction and sexual assault of a top actress and his brother anoop was at the temple to offer special prayers on his behalf.p gopalakrishnan, the president of the travancore dewasom board that administers the famous hill shrine at sabarimala was also here last november when a petition challenging its age-old tradition of not allowing women into the temple was being heard at the supreme court.the top court is yet to give its ruling on whether to allow women into sabarimala, but devotees of ?judge uncle? believe his blessings are a sure shot way to salvation. the bellary baron is facing a myriad of court cases including some relating to mine lease violations.?one of my cases will come up before the court soon and my astrologer advised me to visit the judge uncle,? he said on the condition of anonymity.according to folklore, the temple has its roots in   th century when the erstwhile kingdom of travancore had a judge named govinda pillai who was known for his impartial judgments. once, his nephew was involved in a criminal case and pillai ordered his execution. later, evidence surfaced about the nephew?s innocence.pillai was filled with remorse and he approached the king, requesting that he be punished for his erroneous judgment. the king said the judge must decide his own punishment, following which pillai ordered his own execution. he also ruled that his body be exhibited at a public place for three days.pillai?s commitment to justice moved many and the people later built a temple to ?give eternal peace to his soul?. the case diary with pillai?s own observations on palmira leaves ordering his execution serves as the deity of the temple.?people from faraway places come here. and many believers request the temple to keep their identity confidential,? said temple manager gopinathan nair.?people involved in minor disputes to major crimes come here with lot of hope,? said deva narayanan, a retired government employee. the bellary mining baron currently doing the rounds of the temple happens to be just one of them.

"shiv sena mp ravindra gaikwad, who has been banned from flying by several airlines after he assaulted an air india staffer on march   , reached delhi on wednesday via a chartered flight, according to sources.shiv sena is all set to create ruckus in parliament on thursday to push for its demand to revoke the flying ban against its mp ravindra gaikwad. the chartered flight by which gaikwad flew in to delhi is believed to have been provided by another shiv sena mp rajkumar dhoot. sources say gaikwad will be reaching parliament on april  . shiv sena is expected to create ruckus in parliament against the ban imposed on him.  sena mps had approached civil aviation minister ashok gajapathi raju seeking his intervention into the matter, but they failed to get any assurance from him. shiv sena threatens to create ruckusshiv sena mp anand adsul, while speaking in the zero hour on wednesday, said that no one was listening to his party.

"a growing number of women in iran are refusing to wear a hijab while driving, sparking a nationwide debate about whether a car is a private space where they can dress more freely.obligatory wearing of the hijab has been an integral policy of the islamic republic since the      revolution but it is one the establishment has had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. many iranian women are already pushing the boundaries, and observers in tehran say women who drive with their headscarves resting on their shoulders are becoming a familiar sight.clashes between women and iran?s morality police particularly increase in the summer when temperatures rise. but even though the police regularly stop these drivers, fining them or even temporarily seizing their vehicle, such acts of resistance have continued, infuriating hardliners over a long-standing policy they have had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. iran?s moderate president, hassan rouhani, has argued that people?s private space should be respected and opposes a crackdown on women who don?t wear the hijab. he said explicitly that the police?s job is not to administer islam. speaking in     , rouhani said: ?the police can?t do something and say i?m doing this because god said so. that?s not a police [officer]?s business.?many in iran believe that private space includes the inside of a car, but judicial authorities and the police have opposed that interpretation. ?the invisible part of the car, such as the trunk, is a private space, but this does not apply to the visible parts of the car,? hadi sadeghi, the deputy head of iran?s judiciary chief, said last week. his comments have prompted widespread reaction online, with one user posting a satirical picture showing a couple embracing in a car boot. another user tweeted: ?the police have said that only the boot is a private space... poor those of us who have a hatchback car [without a boot]... we don?t have any private space.? local media often refrain from directly criticising the mandatory hijab, but the debate over what constitutes a private space has allowed newspapers and even state news agencies to publish articles reflecting views from both sides. ?private or not private?? asked an article carried by the state irna news agency on monday. ?this is a question that has created a legal and religious discussion about private space within cars.? hossein ahmadiniaz, a lawyer, told irna that infringing on people?s private spaces was like infringing their citizen?s rights, arguing that it was up to parliamentarians to define the private space and not the police. ?the law says that the space within a car is a private space,? he said. ?the government?s citizen?s rights charter [launched by rouhani] also considers a car to be a private space and it is incumbent upon enforcers to respect that.?bahman keshavarz, a leading lawyer, wrote an article in the reformist shargh daily, arguing that wearing a so-called ?bad hijab? (loose hijab) is not a crime under iranian law. saeid montazeralmahdi, a spokesperson for the iranian police, disagreed. ?what is visible to the public eye is not private space and norms and the rules should be respected within cars.? he also warned car owners against using tinted glass to prevent onlookers from seeing into the car. the debate is not only among liberal iranians. abolfazl najafi tehrani, a cleric based in tehran, tweeted: ?people?s cars, like people?s houses, are their property and a private space and infringing upon this space will disturb people?s moral security and will harm women?s trust with the police.?yahya kamalpour, a member of the iranian parliament, said: ?the space within people?s cars is a private space and the police has no right to enter that space without a judicial order.?the debate comes amid a growing rift between the government and the hardline judiciary that acts independently of rouhani?s government. despite restrictions, women are increasingly active in iranian society. it emerged on sunday that iran air, the country?s national airline, has for the first time appointed a female ceo. rouhani is also under pressure from his voter base to nominate a record number of female ministers in his cabinet reshuffle next month. in a sign of slowly changing attitudes, ali karimi, a veteran iranian footballer, on monday called on the authorities to allow female fans to attend stadiums alongside men.

""we still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. we need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today,"" murthy,   , told students of the prestigious darden school of business at the university of virginia here. murthy, the recipient of the      thomas jefferson foundation medal in global innovation, was responding to darden school of business dean scott beardsley who asked, ""what do you think needs to happen next to transform indias economy. what is next"". ""we want our youngsters to be a little bit more daring in taking the entrepreneurial route more and more than the extent to which they do today. we have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. ""and most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. i would say these are required (for transforming indias economy to the next level),"" murthy said. he, however, refrained from elaborating what the indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, ""i will tell you why, as an indian citizen, it may not be proper if i were to be critical about india when i am outside india"". interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started infosys. those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. ""today, challenges are different. but in some sense even more complex, because todays entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it. ""therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in india,"" he said. murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. ""respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation,"" he said. ""to be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of thomas jefferson, author of declaration of independence is to me a big honour. i will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part,"" he told pti. the fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from india, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, murthy said. ""therefore this is a clear example of how indian students wherever they are whether in india or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated,"" he said. murthy said that indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying. ","to transform india's economy, it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that india is integrated with the global economy, infosys co-founder narayana murthy has said. further, he said there is a need to reduce ""friction"" in businesses and create an ""environment"" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs.

"washington, apr    (pti) inspired by the chinese and japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. despite the many advances in portable electronic devices, one thing remains constant - the need to plug them into a wall socket to recharge. portable electronic devices, such as watches, hearing aids and heart monitors, often require only a little energy. they usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries. researchers from georgia institute of technology in the us and chongqing university in china wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements. they have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (tengs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics. however, most teng devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy. researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit. the four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element. ","scientists have developed a lightweight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements. the inner surfaces are coated with gold and a carbon polymer film, comprising the electric nanogenerator. pressing and releasing the device for a few minutes charged the device to   volt, which was enough to power a remote control or a watch, researchers said."

"for over a month now, delhi has been witnessing a bizarre protest at jantar mantar. the protesters, who are farmers from tamil nadu, have used strategies never heard before ? from wearing skulls, eating mice, conducting mock funerals to even stripping at raisina hill. adding to their eyeball popping agitation this week, a man dressed as prime minister narendra modi flogged the farmers with a whip.        the farmers said the idea was to show centre?s ?insensitivity? to their plights. ?by ignoring us, it is like modi is whipping us and trying to beat us out of delhi? sometimes i think if we get arrested it might be better. jail would be better than this,? said p ayyakkannu, the state president of the national south-indian rivers linking farmers? association. at the outset,    farmers had volunteered to participate in the flogging, but soon after it began    of them backed out. one protester even reportedly fainted because of the pain.  prakash, who carried out the flogging wore one of the popular modi masks and was dressed in the pm?s trademark jacket and kurta.  a protester bites on to a mouse to depict loss of livelihood due to drought.         (saumya khandelwal/ht photo)         these farmers have been in delhi for    days now and are in no mood to leave. their protest  is aimed at getting a relief package from the centre and having their loans waved off as their crops were ruined in a severe drought and a subsequent cyclone.  their loans from cooperative banks have already been written off, under orders of the state government and the madras high court. they have also asked for revised drought packages, that would allow them to buy seeds for the next harvest cycle and also compensate their losses.protesters use skulls and noose to depict suicides by their fellow farmers.

"the congress party may have opposed jalikattu with its full force but today it stands a divided house. even as party chief spokesman randeep surjewala walks a cautious line there are leaders like digvijaya singh who outrightly support it. but what puts congress in a spot is a letter accessed exclusively by india today written by former prime  minister manmohan singh while in opposition expressing strong disapproval for this age old tamil tradition that has become the focus of the country's polity now.the letter is dated december   ,      when the congress was in opposition and dr singh seized to be the prime minister. this letter was written in the capacity of a rajya sabha mp to ng jayasimha,the managing director of humane society international (india). humane society argued strongly against jalikattu like many other organisations like people for ethical treatment to animal or peta that is at the receiving end of people's ire in tamil nadu today. in the said letter dr manmohan singh remarked, ""the human society international/india affiliate has a worthy objective and certainly we have to discourage bullfights which provide a cruel form of entertainment"". dr singh didn't stop there but went on to ""wish you all success in achieving your objective"" of getting bull fight which is popularly known as jalikattu banned.this letter is in sync with the views expressed by many ministers in the upa regime like jairam ramesh. but come today the scenario is absolutely different. a popular uprising along the marina beach of chennai in demand of the sport that tamils call an inherent part of their culture has forced many political parties to modulate their views. congress' chief spokesman  randeep surjewala in a tweet put the onus on the centre and taking a neutral view much away from manmohan singh's militant opinion on jalikattu said, ""congress respects people of tamil nadu in preserving the culture & tradition of jallikattu more so as adequate safety precautions is taken. people have a legitimate right to protect their pride & conserve their culture. govt's duty to strike a balance & respect the sentiments."" something that was  'cruel entertainment' in      turned into a 'legitimate right' in january      for congress, thanks to the popular mood.well that is not all. even as surjewala tries to undo the damage, its another spokesperson and a senior lawyer abhishek manu singhvi doubles up as the counsel for the petitioners calling for a ban on the bull-taming sport of jallikattu. according to him, jallikattu is not a sport, it is a ""brutal and wanton"" torture of an animal and that since holding jallikattu is not permissible under law after the supreme court order, even supporting or encouraging it is defiance of the supreme court order. so as jalikattu debate rages on, the congress is a divided house with no single school of thought. it's general secretary supports it, it's media chief maintains a neutral view as another leader fights for the ones it's own party is not ready to openly back. and amid all these the letter bomb is surely going to put the grand old party in an even more uncomfortable spot. ","former pm manmohan singh, in a letter dated     , had termed the bull-taming sport jallikattu a ""cruel form of entertainment"", while the congress party has supported the protests against its ban in     . adding that traditional jallikattu must be allowed, congress leader digvijaya singh has said that it is much better than bullfighting in spain where the bull is killed."
"hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital india. so, a swift search on online marketplaces such as olx shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.the environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. the rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline hindu supporters of the narendra modi government. the madurai bench of the madras high court on tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.ravi sharma from uttar pradesh's holy city varanasi, which prime minister modi represents in parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for rs   ,   . he first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.not far away from varanasi, in ghazipur, bheem singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. so much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as    per cent less than the market price for cows. ""it's too dangerous keeping cows any more. anyone can come and beat us,"" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.the past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on muslims and lower caste hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. a group of alleged ""cow protectors"" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on may   . police in rajasthan's bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the rss - the bjp's ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.several state governments have appealed to the pm to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. some have decided to drag the centre to court. environment minister harsh vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government's order. ""the aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle"" in the markets,"" he had said. but many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of christians, muslims and poor hindus of a cheap source of protein.it's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. they have been available occasionally under the pets section. but there has been a sudden surge since the bjp swept to power in uttar pradesh in march with priest-turned politician yogi adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes.","days after the centre banned the sale of cattle for slaughter in the animal markets across the country, cows are being sold online on e-marketplaces such as olx. ""it's too dangerous keeping cows anymore. anyone can come and beat us,"" said a cattle owner adding that he was open to a distress sale for   % less than the market price."
"justice kr shriram will be convening his court at    am on thursday so that he can finish hearing the arguments with regards to the release of film rangoon, and probably pass an order. the court is hearing a petition filed by wadia movietone pvt ltd which has dragged rangoon makers to court over an uncanny resemblance between kangana ranaut's character, julia, and fearless nadia, the pre-independence era australian actress mary evans. evans had taken up the screen name of nadia, and had acted in many films like hunterwali. wadia lawyers navroz seervai and priyanka khimani had told the court that there were    similarities between their       movie, hunterwali, featuring fearless nadia, and rangoon's trailer.on monday, the court had asked both the parties to consider settling the issue, but none was ready to bow down. senior advocate virendra tuljapurkar cited various judgements of indian courts to show that copyright law does not cover a character. ""you cannot copyright a character. under american laws it can be, but they are redundant in india as a copyright over a character does not exist.""tuljapurkar also said that the character of fearless nadia was developed by homi wadia and his brother who wrote, directed and produced the films. ""it was later that a company was formed which took over the films. but in their own petition they say that they are still in the process of looking for the scripts and screenplays. so they themselves do not have the copyright. do they have documents showing title, assignment that the author has given it to them?""senior advocate ravi kadam, on behalf of viacom    motion pictures, told the court that no film had the character of fearless nadia. the actress used to be called fearless as she used to do daring stunts herself. moreover, evans was one of the few actresses who started working in films when not many women dared to do so and that's why she was nicknamed fearless nadia. ""it's like calling hema malini, the dream girl. the actor has played many characters but she is known as dream girl. now one cannot have a copyright over dream girl,"" said kadam. he added that the film is set at the time of pre-independence era. ""no claim can be made around historical facts. fearless nadia is a historic figure,"" argued kadam. he said the film is about a dancer julia who is in love with the director played by saif ali khan. she later goes to burma where she meets a soldier played by shahid kapoor, who is working for the indian national army and is on a secret mission.kadam accepted that the rangoon makers were in talks with the wadias for copyright on fearless nadia between      and     . emails showing the conversations between the two parties were perused by the petitioners. ""however when they said that the copyright is already been given to someone else it was not pursued any further,"" said kadam.","responding to a petition claiming that kangana ranaut's character in 'rangoon' is based on australian stunt actor mary evans, popularly known as 'fearless nadia', the makers have said that one cannot copyright a character in india. ""it's like calling hema malini the 'dream girl'... now one cannot have a copyright over dream girl,"" said an advocate."

has the widespread and cheap availability of  g data since the entry of jio affected google's railtel strategy in any way?this is a great question. very relevant in today's time. what we have seen is that as  g has emerged, we have seen no dip in the wi-fi usage. if you talk about the time when 'free'  g started emerging, we were at about   million (   lakh) monthly active users, today we are at  .  million (   lakh) monthly active users. so the railtel initiative has only grown since then.the railway station is a great point of convergence. at this point of convergence, there is the need for multiple networks and multiple systems to satisfy the user demand. before the advent of 'free'  g, people were not even thinking of consuming  gb data a month, let alone  gb data a day.the mark of telecommunication development of any country is how close the fiber is to the user. in effect, you must see that the wi-fi that we are implementing is an attempt to bring fiber close to the user. and that is working pretty well for us.q: during my interactions with passengers and workers at the nizzamudin railway station, i found out that many of them feel that during peak hours the speed slows down quite a bit. is that something you are looking into?i feel that is also a very interesting, emerging phenomenon. if you see when we started the project, even at peak hours the speed we were giving the users was very satisfactory and now people want more. this is exactly what we were expecting. once people start experiencing high-speed internet, the user behavior changes - the expectation now is higher. there is more demand for less and less latency in the network.the good news for us is that across the last twelve months, we have not seen a dip in monthly active users. the average usage still remains    mb per user per session which shows we have augmented the network and capacity while adding more users.as  g has emerged, we have seen no dip in the wi-fi usage. if you talk about the time when 'free'  g started emerging, we were at about   million monthly active users, today we are at  .  million monthly active usersmr gulzar azad then spoke about how google is taking steps to make the railtel initiative financially viablesince april, we have made the login process ad supported and that is helping railtel from an isp perspective. the revenue is majorly meant for railtel. we have a revenue share mechanism which is expected as we are a contributor to the project itself - google helps build the wireless (infrastructure) and railtel brings in the fibre and the connectivity.q:the railtel initiative was in the news a couple of months ago as it was found that it was being used for watching porn in many railway stations. were any measures put into place after that?the idea of the internet here from an experience point of view is to make it the same internet that you and i have and for that internet to be available to everyone. that is the singular goal of our vision - for a billion people to experience the internet you and i experience in our homes, in our offices.  and when we do that, we are following the regulations set by the country.the isp (railtel) follows the regulations from the government in terms of what's allowed on the internet and what's not. this internet is not different from every other internet across the country.q: if we talk about the speed, i was told that  mbps is the minimum speed even when the    limit high speed cap is crossed. is that a realistic claim?the way the network has been set up there is actually no speed limit before or after. the design of the network is such that in the first    minute time limit, we allow the user to get unfettered access - the idea is to get all users to a point where they could access high quality hd video streams.after the time limit is crossed, we make sure that everybody does still have internet and the net is still low latency. we are adjusting the network dynamically so that people can still access the internet but in the first half an hour they can access hd quality video streams.q: but what is the minimum speed? - i spoke to many people and got a lot of varying replies. some people said it is as bad as    kbps but others said they can stream video for    hours.the quality of your internet is not just measured by the speed. it is also measured by the latency of the network. we have designed the network in a way that even when the network is at low speed, it is still a low latency network. the internet is dynamically configured in such a way that you will still be able perform certain use cases (like opening a search page, running apps like whatsapp and messenger) after the high-speed cap gets over after    minutes.this is a great advancement. if you compare this with wi-fi in london and san francisco, you will find that the wi-fi is better in both coverage and capacitynote: the network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time. this is why the    minute high-speed cap exists. during our time at the nizamuddin railway station we got average speeds of   -  mpbs (download) during the    minute unfettered limit. also, we found out that all access points are already dual-band ( . ghz and  ghz capable) in order to cope with future demand.q: what is the business model that google and railtel are following? how is google benefiting from this project?for google, this is an ecosystem project. our idea with this is to make sure there is more and more broadband adoption. the more the adoption, the more people come online, and the greater the economic impact.when there is economic impact on digitisation, we get directly impacted because we are a stakeholder in the digitisation of the country. also, the more people use internet, the more they use e-commerce, social networks, news websites and eventually google services.q: at the nizamuddin railway station and the new delhi railway station, which i visited a few weeks ago, the advertising is quite minimal. also a lot of people, even in tier   cities like delhi and mumbai are unaware of this initiative. so what is google and railtel's future plans regarding awareness?addressing awareness of wi-fi is certainly an important issue and we need the help of the indian railways and the government to do that more and more. as you can see, the wi-fi is already free, so there is not much space for businesses to market on it. but the indian railways who host this, they should be partnering with us to make more and more awareness happen.there are various channels of awareness. we have tried audio announcements and visuals. we have also tried having agents at the station. i think to raise awareness in a sustainable way we need help from the government.","google's head of connectivity in india recently talked about the google railtel, which has started providing free wifi at     railway stations in india. ""if you compare this with wi-fi in london and san francisco, you will find that the wi-fi is better in both coverage and capacity"", he said. the initiative aims to cover     stations across the country."

"(eds: correcting year of verdict in paras    and   ) new delhi, jul    (pti) right to privacy cannot be an absolute right and the state may have some power to put reasonable restriction, the supreme court said today while examining the issue whether it can be declared as a fundamental right under the constitution. a nine-judge constitution bench, headed by chief justice j s khehar, also asked the centre and others to assist it about the ""contours"" and ambit of test on which the width and scope of right to privacy and its infringement, if any, by the state would be tested. the bench then referred to the apex court judgement, criminalising gay sex and said if right to privacy was construed in its widest sense, then the verdict in the naz foundation case ""would become vulnerable"". the ngo, naz foundation, has been fighting a legal battle for decriminalising consensual unnatural sex including lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders. during the day-long hearing, the bench, also comprising justices j chelameswar, s a bobde, r k agrawal, rohinton fali nariman, abhay manohar sapre, d y chandrachud, sanjay kishan kaul and s abdul nazeer, said, ""right to privacy is an amorphous right and not absolute. it is only a small sub-sect of liberty."" it then gave illustrations including that giving birth to offsprings might fall under right to privacy and the parents could not say that the government did not have the power to direct sending every child to schools. it also referred to issue of data protection and said that its ambit was ""much wider"" than right to privacy and ""cataloguing the contents of privacy"" has the danger of limiting the right itself. ""we live in an age of big data and the state is entitled to regulate the data whether it is for the purpose of regulating crime, taxation or other activities... right to privacy cannot be so absolute that it prevents the state from legislating or regulating it,"" the bench said. if a bank has sought personal details for disbursing loans then it could not be said to be an infringement of right to privacy, it said, adding that the issues like ones sexual orientation and the bedroom details were covered under right to privacy. senior advocate gopal subramanium, appearing for one of the petitioners, initiated the arguments and said right to privacy was an ""inalienable"" and ""inherent"" to the most important fundamental right which the right to liberty. he said the right to liberty, which also included right to privacy, was a pre-existing ""natural right"" which the constitution acknowledged and guaranteed to the citizens in case of infringements by the state. ""liberty is the fundamental value of our constitution. life and liberty are natural existing rights which our constitution acknowledges and guarantees. how can liberty be at all experienced without privacy?,"" he asked. subramanium, at the outset, referred to apex court verdicts to highlight the process of interpretation of fundamental rights by it and assailed the two judgements delivered in m p sharma and kharak singh cases by an eight- judge and six judge benches in      and      respectively in which it was held that right to privacy was not a fundamental right. the issue of right to privacy as a fundamental right was deliberated upon by the court in the two cases. ""it is submitted that the decision in the      and      cases, to the extent they interpret fundamental rights on a distinctive basis (as recognised in the a k gopalan case of     ) are no longer good law. ""in view of the fact that the a k gopalan case stands overruled in the r c cooper case (of     ), it follows a fortiori (from a stronger argument) that neither of the above decisions are effective."" he assailed the m p sharma verdict which had held that right to privacy was not a fundamental right, saying that the m p sharma case was not ""an authority for the proposition that there is no fundamental right to privacy in the constitution"". he argued that right to privacy is inherent to the right to liberty and the constitution ""mediates"" between the citizens and the state and the concept of privacy is ""embedded in liberty as well as honour of a person"". he then referred to the preamble and article    (equality before law),    (freedom of speech and expression) and    (protection of life and liberty) of the constitution to contend that right to privacy was intrinsic to these ""inalienable"" fundamental rights also. the counsel assailed the contention of attorney general k k venugopal that right to privacy was a ""common law right"" and not the fundamental one and said it ""went much beyond the common law"" as it was inherently attached to the basic rights of life and liberty. ""right to privacy invariably means the inviolability of the person. the expression person includes the body as well as the inviolate personality and the privacy really is intended to indicate the realm of inviolable sanctuary that most of us sense in our beings. ""it refers to spatial sanctity, freedom in decisional autonomy, informational privacy as well as the ability to freely develop ones personality and exercise discretion and judgement,"" he said. former attorney general soli sorabjee, appearing in support of privacy right, went much beyond and said even if the constitution did not ""explicitly"" provide this right, it could be deduced as had been done in the case of freedom of press. he referred to article    and said it dealt with the freedom of speech and expression and the apex court deduced the media right from it. another senior advocate shyam divan also said privacy right was a fundamental right according to the ""golden triangle"" rule that comprised article   ,    and   . ""as recognised by an unbroken line of decisions of this court since     , right to privacy is protected under part iii of the constitution. this court has recognised several unenumerated rights as facets of article   . ""similarly, right to privacy has also been recognised as flowing from article   ,"" he said. he said that right to privacy extends to several aspects, including body integrity, personal autonomy, right to be left alone, informational self-determination and protection from state surveillance. the bench, at one point, stopped divan from raising issues relating to aadhaar that that government could not force citizens to give biometric details and asked him to focus on the privacy issue alone. when the bench asked whether privacy right could be absolute and the government could put some restriction or not, he said that the aspect of privacy might be determined on a case-to-case basis. ""in a technologically dynamic society it is imperative to keep dimensions of right to privacy flexible to adapt and adjust with the new scenarios,"" he said, adding many of the fundamental rights ""cannot be enjoyed to the fullest in the absence of right to privacy"". he further referred to the fact that india is a signatory to the universal declaration on human rights and now to say that right to privacy is a common law right only will be a ""regressive"" step. ","the supreme court on wednesday observed that the right to privacy is not absolute and the state may put reasonable restrictions on it. privacy is an ""amorphous"" term and defining it would be impossible, the court added. it further referred to the issue of data protection and said that its ambit was ""much wider"" than the right to privacy.

"the guardian was wrong to report in january that the popular messaging service whatsapp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech.but it was right to bring to wide public notice an aspect of whatsapp that had the potential to make some messages vulnerable to being read by an unintended recipient.the guardian did not test with an appropriate range of experts a claim that had implications for the more than one billion people who use the facebook-owned whatsapp.in a detailed review i found that misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings happened at several stages of the reporting and editing process. cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case.the guardian ought to have responded more effectively to the strong criticism the article generated from well-credentialled experts in the arcane field of developing and adapting end-to-end encryption for a large-scale messaging service.the original article ? now amended and associated with the conclusions of this review ? led to follow-up coverage, some of which sustained the wrong impression given at the outset. the most serious inaccuracy was a claim that whatsapp had a ?backdoor?, an intentional, secret way for third parties to read supposedly private messages. this claim was withdrawn within eight hours of initial publication online, but withdrawn incompletely. the story retained material predicated on the existence of a backdoor, including strongly expressed concerns about threats to freedom, betrayal of trust and benefits for governments which surveil. in effect, having dialled back the cause for alarm, the guardian failed to dial back expressions of alarm.this made a relatively small, expert, vocal and persistent audience very angry. guardian editors did not react to an open letter co-signed by    experts in a way commensurate with the combined stature of the critics and the huge number of people potentially affected by the story. the essence of the open letter and a hyperlink to it were added to the article, but wider consultation and a fundamental reconsideration of the story were needed.the aspect of whatsapp at the heart of this matter, put very simply, is as follows. when a user of whatsapp is offline, any messages at that time in transit to him or her are held in facebook?s servers. (if unclaimed after    days they are deleted, facebook advised.) if, while offline, the recipient registers a new device, any messages waiting for the person on facebook?s servers are no longer deliverable because they are encrypted for the person?s old device. to prevent those messages from being lost, when the intended recipient comes back online, any in-transit messages are re-encrypted with the new device?s key and resent automatically. if senders have turned on a notification setting in whatsapp on their phone, they are told that the key has changed, but not otherwise.critics said that the guardian article overstated the risk of what is known in the jargon as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party could exploit the combination of offline phone, messages in transit and changed key to intercept private communications.the intensity of the external criticism seems to have stemmed partly from frustration that the article was in the guardian, with its deserved reputation for using and reporting on technology in ways that help bridge the gap between non-experts and specialists.some were concerned that an overstated claim in the guardian about risk to the security of whatsapp would cause non-expert users to become unduly worried and needlessly abandon whatsapp for less secure communication methods.the critics had two different groups of whatsapp users in mind.first, the vast majority of users, for whom whatsapp security is fine and who would probably experience worse communications security if they stopped using it.second, a much smaller group, activists in authoritarian regimes, whose threat model means they need high security and for whom the popularity of whatsapp means they can ?blend into the crowd?. this group could be at serious risk if they abandoned whatsapp for something less secure, or perhaps even for a service more secure but used by relatively few, because that might attract the authorities? attention.a related concern was that authoritarian governments could exploit the guardian story to move against the use of encrypted messaging.during the review i independently confirmed that a turkish government official had used the article when, in effect, attempting to deter users from whatsapp. it was also confirmed that some activists who had been in the process of switching from a less secure messaging service to whatsapp became confused by the guardian story. on available evidence, i am unable to conclude whether these effects were widespread. but one case is one too many.i am not an expert in this field. for the review i consulted suitably experienced experts other than the    who had already declared their view.i found a consensus that in practice, as whatsapp is presently understood, it would be very difficult to use this aspect of whatsapp for systematic targeted surveillance. experts described challenges with timing, targeting and concealment which they said would be formidable even for a major private or public actor with access to facebook servers.experts were unanimous that it is not a backdoor. ?vulnerability? is a contested term, acceptable in this context to some but not all. one called it a ?weakness?, others a ?trade-off?.one expert called whatsapp ?pretty excellent security against broad surveillance and that is valuable?. another said the trade-off was reasonable. a third said: ?this product is safe for the majority of people.?i conveyed to facebook one specialist?s proposal that the relevant notification setting should be default opt-out, not default opt-in, so that although in-transit messages would continue to be resent automatically, at least senders would be informed that it had happened unless they turned the notification setting off. facebook replied: ?yes, whatsapp considered this but decided against it when considering how it might be interpreted by the average user, who may be using a smartphone for the first time. instead we chose to make this option available to those wanting an extra layer of security on their accounts.?experts confirmed that weighing these kinds of considerations about user behaviour is normal when designers are deciding the balance between security and usability in a mass-market service like whatsapp. the experts confirmed the gist of the responses to the core guardian article blogged on the day of its publication by two leading figures in developing whatsapp, moxie marlinspike and brian acton.several independent experts agreed with this part of the open letter?s criticism when it was read to them:?it?s important to recognize the tendency of many security researchers, especially inexperienced ones, to overestimate the practical impact of vulnerabilities they find, and being ignorant how security needs play out in the real world, the massive amount of work on actual user behavior in the face of friction and warnings, and the need for independent verification and context.?i accept the consensus view of the experts and, in consultation with editors, have arranged for the coverage to be amended and for a note to be added drawing attention to the review and linking to this column.i do not agree with critics that the story should be entirely retracted. after all the surrounding controversy, the story?s complete disappearance would be odd. more importantly, there is a clear public interest in the guardian preserving (with appropriate amendments) reporting on this aspect of whatsapp and the inherent trade-off. with so many users, watchfulness, news, analysis and debate about the security of whatsapp are important. communications privacy is a key element of human rights in the digital era, and developments affecting it ought to be reported. also, facebook needs scrutiny, both generally due to its power and specifically in its management of whatsapp.facebook?s plan last year to share within its group of companies whatsapp users? personal information caused controversy and appeared to breach prior commitments. regulators stepped in, including in the uk. at least one court has upheld a regulator?s intervention.as one expert noted, facebook?s servers are a black box. it is not possible for outsiders to verify exactly what happens when messages pass through facebook?s servers on their way to and from whatsapp users. trust is required. given facebook?s record, steady scrutiny is the right stance.we learned from edward snowden?s disclosures that large service providers which handle the communications of millions of people have been compromised in the past. sections of a research paper published in march      provide a more recent review of encryption workarounds.the uk home secretary, amber rudd, has wondered aloud whether service providers should continue to be able lawfully to deny to government authorities access to encrypted messaging. measures affecting the security of encrypted messaging seem likely to be among new anti-terrorism proposals.i found a consistent view among experts that facebook could do more to make non-expert users aware of the trade-off and educate them about how to assess their own threat model.since the guardian article, whatsapp has been better secured by the introduction of optional two-factor verification in february. that process was being tested in november      and had been reported in a specialist blog in july     , so the guardian coverage did not prompt the improvement. we will probably never know whether it spurred facebook to accelerate the process.","british publication the guardian has admitted its january      report on a loophole in whatsapp's security system was incorrect. the report had claimed that the backdoor lets the facebook-owned chat app intercept and read users' encrypted messages. the newspaper has said that ""misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings"" happened at several stages of the article's reporting process."

"the spring may have gone out of mulayam singh yadav's step after he was unseated from the leadership of the samajwadi party by his son akhilesh yadav, but he still retains his ability to sting. evidence of that came at the rally that he addressed this afternoon at jaswantnagar in his home district of etwah. he  came here asking for votes for his brother shivpal yadav but what was more interesting was his open support for a lok dal candidate from the etwah seat.mulayam rooting for the lok dal candidate is significant. the party exists mainly on paper and is distinct from the rashtriya lok dal, which is headed by ajit singh. after mulayam singh yadav was tossed out as the president of his party, he, along with shivpal, toyed with the idea of taking over the lok dal, but ultimately decided against it.speculation abounds in political circles that close to    of the duo's loyalists who were denied tickets by the sp are now contesting on the lok dal ticket. if a handful of them manage to win, they could strengthen mulayam's hand in the event of a hung assembly.also read: samajwadi feud: mulayam-akhilesh fight leaves shivpal supporters in limboyadav clan absent at shivpal rallyalthough etwah happens to be the family bastion of the yadav family, not one member of the larger yadav clan has been out seeking votes for shivpal. conspicuous by their absence from today's rally were the chief minister and mps ram gopal yadav, dimple yadav, dharmendar yyadav, tej pratap yadav and akshay yadav.a significant feature of shivpal's campaign and today's rally was that votes were sought in the name of mulayam singh yadav and the development work that has taken place in the district during his time as chief minister and by shivpal as the state irrigation and pwd minister. no mention was made of akhilesh yadav or any of that development work done by his government.","samajwadi party patriarch mulayam singh yadav on saturday campaigned for his brother shivpal singh yadav in etawah and also sought votes for a lok dal candidate. he, however, didn't mention up cm akhilesh yadav's name. this came amid reports that some mulayam's loyalists, who were denied tickets by the sp, are now contesting on the lok dal ticket."
"washington, feb    (pti) nasa plans to send its first robotic spacecraft to the sun next year that is slated to get within six million kilometres of the blazing star to probe its atmosphere. humans have sent spacecraft to the moon, mars and even distant interstellar space. now, nasa plans to launch the solar probe plus mission to the sun which is about     million kilometres from the earth.
